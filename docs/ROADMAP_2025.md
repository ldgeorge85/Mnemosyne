# Mnemosyne Protocol: Technical Roadmap 2025
*Building Cognitive Sovereignty Infrastructure*

## Overview

This roadmap implements **cognitive sovereignty** through iterative development, with each phase adding depth while maintaining utility. The system grows from personal tool to collective intelligence platform through natural emergence rather than forced complexity.

## Research Track (Parallel)

### Active Research Areas

**PIE Pipeline Validation**:
- Synthetic data generation with LLMs/GANs
- Longitudinal stability studies
- Cross-cultural validity testing
- Privacy attack resistance

**Trust Dynamics Modeling**:
- Network effect simulations

## Risk Mitigation Strategy

### Technical Risks
1. **ML Performance**: Fallback to higher dimensions or ensembles
2. **ZK Efficiency**: Use optimistic verification if needed
3. **Symbolic Quality**: Resort to clustering if classifiers fail

### Adoption Risks
1. **Complexity**: Progressive disclosure with simple defaults
2. **Privacy Concerns**: Optional encrypted cloud backup
3. **Gaming/Attacks**: Reputation burning and quarantine

### Fallback Positions
- PIE â†’ Standard embeddings
- Kartouche â†’ Simple avatars
- TTF â†’ Traditional reputation
- Collective â†’ Standard groups

## Success Metrics

### Phase 2 (Identity & Trust)
- [ ] PIE system generates stable, meaningful representations
- [ ] Kartouches achieve >85% user recognition
- [ ] TTF enables trust without privacy compromise
- [ ] Beta users report increased agency

### Phase 3 (Collective Intelligence)
- [ ] Resonance algorithms predict compatibility >70% accuracy
- [ ] Agent communication achieves semantic fidelity
- [ ] Collectives demonstrate emergent capabilities
- [ ] Dissolution occurs gracefully

### Phase 4 (Scale)
- [ ] System handles 100k+ concurrent users
- [ ] Third-party ecosystem emerges
- [ ] Cross-cultural adoption validated
- [ ] Sovereignty preserved at scale

## Resource Requirements

### Team (Minimum Viable)
- 2 ML Engineers (PIE, symbolic systems)
- 1 Cryptography Engineer (ZK, protocols)
- 2 Full-stack Developers (integration)
- 1 UX Designer (kartouche, interfaces)
- 1 Research Coordinator

### Infrastructure
- GPU compute: $5k/month
- Testing environment: 10k synthetic users
- Beta program: 100-500 real users
- Security audits: $50k per phase

## Conclusion

This roadmap charts a path from the current working system to a complete cognitive sovereignty platform. By focusing on empirically validated approaches (PIE, TTF) while preserving philosophical depth (Kartouche, symbolic overlays), we can build something both practical and transformative.

The phased approach allows continuous value delivery while managing risk. Each phase builds on the previous, with clear fallback positions if approaches prove unviable.

Most importantly, this roadmap maintains the project's commitment to user sovereignty, privacy, and agency at every step.
