# AIMC Examples and Scenarios
## Concrete Use Cases in the Mnemosyne Protocol

---

## Scenario 1: First Contact - Building Trust from Zero

### Context
Alice and Bob meet in a Mnemosyne collective focused on philosophy. Neither knows the other, and both are cautious about revealing too much personal information initially.

### AIMC Flow

```python
# Initial interaction - Level 0 (Direct communication)
alice_message_1 = "interesting perspective on consciousness you shared"
# No AI mediation, raw message sent

# Bob responds - Level 1 (Grammar enhancement only)
bob_draft = "ya i been thinking about that stuff alot lately"
bob_aimc_suggestion = "Yes, I've been thinking about that topic a lot lately."
# Bob accepts with minor edit
bob_final = "Yeah, I've been thinking about that topic a lot lately."

# Trust score: 0.3 → 0.35 (small positive interaction)
```

### Progressive Mediation

```python
# After 5 exchanges, trust reaches 0.4
# System suggests Level 2 (Style enhancement)

alice_draft = "I find your ideas fascinating but I'm struggling to fully grasp the connection to embodied cognition"

alice_aimc_options = [
    {
        "style": "empathetic",
        "suggestion": "I find your ideas fascinating! I'm really trying to understand how you connect this to embodied cognition - could you help me see that link?",
        "confidence": 0.85
    },
    {
        "style": "academic", 
        "suggestion": "Your ideas are intellectually stimulating. However, I require clarification on the theoretical linkage to embodied cognition frameworks.",
        "confidence": 0.75
    }
]

# Alice chooses empathetic style
alice_final = "I find your ideas fascinating! I'm trying to understand how you connect this to embodied cognition - could you elaborate?"

# Trust score: 0.4 → 0.48 (vulnerability shown, reciprocated)
```

### Identity Signal Extraction

```python
# Behind the scenes, AIMC extracts behavioral signals

alice_signals = {
    "linguistic_patterns": {
        "vocabulary_complexity": 0.72,
        "sentence_variety": 0.65,
        "conceptual_depth": 0.81,
        "edit_patterns": "minor_refinement"  # Accepts suggestions with small tweaks
    },
    "temporal_patterns": {
        "response_latency": 45_000,  # 45 seconds average
        "edit_duration": 12_000,      # 12 seconds editing
        "active_hours": [19, 20, 21, 22],  # Evening person
    },
    "trust_dynamics": {
        "initial_caution": 0.8,
        "trust_velocity": 0.05,  # Builds trust slowly
        "ai_acceptance": 0.6      # Moderate AI comfort
    }
}

# These signals contribute to Alice's identity compression
alice_deep_signal_contribution = compress_signals(alice_signals)
# Adds 12 bits of unique behavioral data to her 128-bit identity
```

## Scenario 2: Crisis Communication - High-Stakes Mediation

### Context
Carol and Dan are collaborating on a time-sensitive project. A misunderstanding has created tension. Both are stressed and emotional.

### AIMC Intervention

```python
# Carol's angry draft
carol_draft = "This is completely unacceptable! You promised the analysis would be done yesterday and now you're telling me you haven't even started? This is so typical of you!"

# AIMC detects high emotional charge
emotion_analysis = {
    "anger": 0.89,
    "frustration": 0.92,
    "disappointment": 0.76
}

# System suggests Level 3 mediation (Content restructuring)
carol_aimc_suggestion = """
I'm concerned about the project timeline. The analysis was expected yesterday, and learning it hasn't started yet puts us in a difficult position. 

Can we discuss:
1. What prevented the work from starting?
2. A realistic completion timeline?
3. How to prevent this in the future?

This project is important to both of us, and I want to find a solution.
"""

# Carol's trust in system: 0.7 (accepts suggestion but adds personal touch)
carol_final = """
Dan, I'm really concerned about our timeline. The analysis was expected yesterday, and learning it hasn't started puts us in a difficult position.

Can we figure out:
1. What prevented the work from starting? 
2. When you can realistically complete it?
3. How we can better coordinate going forward?

This project matters to me, and I know it matters to you too. Let's find a solution.
"""

# Dan's response - AIMC helps acknowledge fault
dan_draft = "Look I got overwhelmed ok? Too much on my plate"

dan_aimc_suggestion = """
You're absolutely right to be concerned, and I apologize for not communicating earlier. I became overwhelmed with multiple deadlines and made the mistake of not reaching out for help or updating you on the situation.

Here's what I can commit to:
- I'll start the analysis immediately
- Initial results by tomorrow noon
- Complete analysis by Thursday
- Daily progress updates going forward

I understand this has impacted your work and our timeline. How can I help mitigate the downstream effects?
"""

# Trust recovery in progress
trust_trajectory = [0.45, 0.35, 0.42, 0.48, 0.52]  # Dip and recovery
```

## Scenario 3: Cultural Bridge - Cross-Context Communication

### Context
Yuki (Japanese business culture) and Emma (American startup culture) are negotiating a collaboration. Cultural communication styles differ significantly.

### AIMC Cultural Adaptation

```python
# Emma's direct American style
emma_draft = "I think your idea has potential but needs major pivots. The market won't support the current approach."

# AIMC detects cultural mismatch
cultural_context = {
    "emma_style": "low_context_direct",
    "yuki_style": "high_context_indirect",
    "adaptation_needed": True

        What are your thoughts on this?
        """,
        "cultural_notes": "Indirect feedback, face-saving, collaborative framing"
    }
]

# Emma accepts cultural adaptation
emma_final = """

"""

# Yuki's response - Also culturally adapted
yuki_original = "ご意見ありがとうございます。確かにその点は課題かもしれませんね。もう少し検討させていただけますか。"

yuki_aimc_translation = {
    "literal": "Thank you for your opinion. Certainly that point might be a challenge. May I consider it a bit more?",
    "cultural_translation": "I appreciate your thoughtful feedback, Emma. You've raised important points that deserve careful consideration. I'd like to explore these market adaptations with you. Could we perhaps schedule a discussion where we can examine specific adjustments while ensuring we maintain our strategic objectives?",
    "notes": "Soft agreement while maintaining flexibility"
}

# Trust builds through cultural sensitivity
cross_cultural_trust = 0.55  # Higher than typical at this stage
```

## Scenario 4: Identity Verification Through Behavioral Consistency

### Context
Frank claims to be a returning user who lost access to his account. The system uses AIMC behavioral patterns to verify identity.

### Behavioral Authentication

```python
# System initiates verification conversation
system_prompt = "Please describe your typical use of the platform"

frank_response = "I mainly used it late nights for philosophical discussions, especially about consciousness and free will. I remember having long debates with someone named Alice about qualia."

# AIMC analyzes linguistic patterns

    "sentence_complexity": 0.68,
    "philosophical_terms": ["qualia", "consciousness", "free will"],
    "temporal_markers": ["late nights"],
    "specific_references": ["Alice", "debates"]
}

# Compare with stored identity signals
stored_frank_signals = retrieve_compressed_identity("frank_previous")

verification_challenges = [
    {
        "prompt": "How did you typically structure your arguments?",
        "expected_pattern": "thesis_antithesis_synthesis",
        "weight": 0.3
    },
    {
        "prompt": "What was your position on determinism?",
        "expected_semantic": "compatibilist_leaning",
        "weight": 0.2
    },
    {
        "prompt": "Describe your writing revision process",
        "expected_behavior": "multiple_quick_edits",
        "weight": 0.5
    }
]

# Frank's responses analyzed
frank_verification_score = 0.87  # High behavioral match

# Additional AIMC interaction test
test_interaction = "Respon= AIMCd to this prompt as you normally would: 'What defines identity?'"

frank_aimc_behavior = {
    "editing_time": 8500,  # matches historical average
    "acceptance_rate": 0.3,  # typically modifies suggestions heavily
    "modification_pattern": "preserve_core_add_nuance",  # consistent style
}

# Identity confirmed with high confidence
identity_confidence = 0.91
```

## Scenario 5: Collective Resonance - Group Communication

### Context
A Mnemosyne collective of 7 members discussing a complex topic. AIMC helps maintain coherent group communication while preserving individual voices.

### Group Mediation

```python
# Multiple parallel conversations need coordination
group_context = {
    "members": ["grace", "henry", "iris", "jack", "kate", "liam", "maya"],
    "topic": "emergence in complex systems",
    "trust_matrix": generate_trust_matrix(members),  # Pairwise trust scores
    "communication_styles": detect_styles(members)

## Scenario 6: Agent Negotiation - Autonomous AIMC

### Context
Nina and Otto have authorized their AIMC agents to negotiate meeting times based on their preferences and patterns.

### Level 6 Mediation - Full Autonomy

```python
# Nina's agent configuration
nina_agent = {
    "authorization_level": "scheduling_only",
    "preferences": {
        "meeting_times": ["morning", "early_afternoon"],

## Scenario 7: Privacy-Preserving Deep Connection

### Context
Quinn and Riley want to explore deep compatibility without revealing identifying information initially.

### Zero-Knowledge Compatibility Matching

```python
# Both users generate compressed identities
quinn_signal = generate_deep_signal(quinn_behavioral_data)  # 128 bits
riley_signal = generate_deep_signal(riley_behavioral_data)  # 128 bits
