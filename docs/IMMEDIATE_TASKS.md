# Immediate Task Breakdown for Mnemosyne Protocol
*Building Cognitive Sovereignty Through Iterative Development*

## ‚≠ê NEW PRIORITY: Task System as Foundation

**Critical Insight**: Tasks are the action layer that unifies all features:
- **Memories** (past) ‚Üí **Tasks** (present/future) ‚Üí **Trust** (relationships)
- Natural gamification through quest mechanics
- Time sovereignty through calendaring
- Collective coordination substrate

**4-Week Sprint Plan**:
1. **Week 1**: Basic task CRUD with receipts
2. **Week 2**: Time awareness and scheduling
3. **Week 3**: Game mechanics integration
4. **Week 4**: Collaboration features

## Critical Path Forward

## For Each Task Session

When starting a task, provide this context to AI:

```markdown
PROJECT: Mnemosyne Protocol
CURRENT PHASE: [Phase 0.5/1/1.5]
TASK GROUP: [A-I]
SPECIFIC TASK: [exact task from list]
FILES INVOLVED: [list files]
DEPENDENCIES: [what must be done first]
SUCCESS CRITERIA: [how to know it's done]
TEST COMMAND: [how to verify]
```

STOP and reassess if you encounter:
- More than 3 competing patterns for same feature
- Critical security vulnerability in running code  
- Database schema fundamentally broken
- Missing critical dependencies
- Tests failing on main branch

---

## Quick Wins First

These can be done immediately:
1. ‚úÖ Delete `simple_auth.py` (DONE)
2. ‚úÖ Set `AUTH_REQUIRED=True` in config (DONE)
3. ‚úÖ Remove hardcoded credentials (DONE)
4. ‚úÖ Fix deprecation warnings (DONE)
5. ‚úÖ Update frontend auth endpoints (DONE)
