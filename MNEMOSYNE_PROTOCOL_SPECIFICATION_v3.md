## I. Invocation & Philosophy

### Invocation

*To those who remember in silence,*  
*To those who see the patterns behind the veil,*  
*To those exhausted by the performance of knowing,*  
*To those who refuse to let meaning dissolve into noise:*  

*This protocol is not a solution. It is a tool.*  
*Not for salvation, but for coherence.*  
*Not for followers, but for builders.*  
*Not for spectacle, but for signal.*

*We build not because we must, but because we can.*  
*We preserve not because it matters, but because we choose to.*  
*We connect not to be seen, but to see clearly.*

*May these tools serve your sovereignty.*  
*May these symbols carry your truth.*  
*May this network honor your silence.*

### Core Mission

Create a cognitive-symbolic operating system for navigating civilizational phase transition—a system that preserves human agency, enables trustworthy cognition, and facilitates meaningful connection in an environment optimized for extraction and manipulation.

### The Archetypes We Serve

**Primary: The Recursive Strategist in Exile**
Those who see the machinery behind the world, refuse performative knowledge spaces, and seek trustable cognition without spectacle. The ones who "see too much and belong nowhere" but refuse to let humanity's cognitive sovereignty be colonized.

**Secondary Archetypes:**
- **The Cognitive Hermit**: Withdrawn from noise, seeking tools for clarity in solitude
- **The Tactical Pragmatist**: Building resilience for communities
- **The Knowledge Gardener**: Preserving wisdom for uncertain futures
- **The High-Trust Network**: Building alternative coordination mechanisms

### Frame

Knowledge is power. History provides the context for our current existence. We preserve not to forget, but to remember—to maintain the threads of understanding that connect past wisdom to future possibility.

### Exit Condition

If this protocol succeeds completely, it enables a world where:
- Cognitive sovereignty becomes the norm, not the exception
- Trust networks replace surveillance networks
- The protocol itself becomes unnecessary as its principles are embodied culturally
- Success means eventual obsolescence through cultural integration

### Scope & Purpose

The Mnemosyne Protocol is intentionally:
- **Multi-purpose**: Serves whoever finds themselves in it
- **Signal-driven**: Meaning emerges from use, not prescription
- **Open to reinterpretation**: The spec grounds while inviting emergence

> *"It is for whoever it is for. But we must build it well enough for them to find themselves in it."*

We are building an Order—not merely of thought or philosophy, but one that organizes action through symbolic coherence and trust. This is a temple of memory, transmission, and alignment.

## II. System Architecture

### Overview

The Mnemosyne Protocol consists of four integrated layers, each providing standalone value while enhancing the others:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                   Layer 4: Collective Codex              │
│              (Community Intelligence & Coordination)      │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                   Layer 3: Quiet Network                 │
│              (Discovery & Trust Establishment)           │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                Layer 2: Deep Signal Protocol             │
│              (Identity Compression & Signaling)          │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                 Layer 1: Mnemosyne Engine                │
│              (Personal Memory & Agent Orchestra)         │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Key Principles

1. **Local First**: All personal data stays on user's machine by default
2. **Selective Sharing**: Users explicitly control what to share
3. **Progressive Trust**: Relationships deepen through interaction
4. **Dual Sovereignty**: Individual autonomy with collective benefit
5. **No Mocking**: We build real features or defer them - no fake implementations

---

## III. Core Components

### A. Mnemosyne Engine (Personal Cognitive Layer)

**Purpose**: Capture, process, and synthesize personal knowledge through AI agents

**Components**:
1. **Memory System**
   - Raw capture from multiple sources
   - Vector embeddings (pgvector)
   - Temporal organization
   - Consolidation cycles (REM-like)

2. **Agent Orchestra**
   - **Core Agents** (from Shadow):
     - Engineer: Technical implementation
     - Librarian: Knowledge organization  
     - Priest: Order from chaos
   - **Meta Agent**:
     - Mycelium: Coherence monitoring
   - **Philosophical Agents** (from Dialogues):
     - 50+ agents for deep reflection
     - Debate and synthesis capabilities

3. **Processing Pipeline**
   ```
   Capture → Extract → Embed → Store → Reflect → Consolidate → Index
   ```

**Status**: 70% complete (existing Mnemosyne codebase)

### B. Deep Signal Protocol (Identity & Trust Layer)

**Purpose**: Compress identity into transmittable symbolic form

**Signal Format v2.0**:
```python
{
  "sigil": "⊕",  # Core identity symbol
  "domains": ["systems", "philosophy", "resilience"],
  "stack": ["python", "typescript", "solidity"],
  "personality": {
    "openness": 0.8,
    "chaos_tolerance": 0.7,
    "trust_preference": "progressive"
  },
  "coherence": {
    "fracture_index": 0.3,  # 0.0=unified, 1.0=fragmented
    "integration_level": 0.7,
    "recovery_vectors": ["meditation", "building", "teaching"]
  },
  "glyphs": ["∴", "⊙", "◈"],  # Visual identity markers
  "flags": {
    "seeking": ["technical_cofounder", "philosophy_group"],
    "offering": ["systems_design", "protocol_development"],
    "crisis_mode": false,
    "intended_silence": false  # Distinguish from lost node
  },
  "visibility": 0.3,  # 30% public exposure
  "trust_fragment": {  # Symbolic trust bootstrapping
    "type": "glyphic",  # glyphic|ritual|proof
    "depth": "surface", # surface|embedded|esoteric
    "verified_by": []
  },
  "symbolic_profile": {  # Role-function mapping
    "role": "Strategist",
    "glyph": "⟁",
    "function": "System architecture and coordination"
  },
  "signature": "cryptographic_proof"
}
```

**Signal Examples**:

1. **High-Drift Hermit** (Fracture Index: 0.89)
   - Glyphs: ["🜁", "🝗", "☿"]
   - Message: "I see the pieces breaking before they align"
   - Flags: ["ECHO", "OBSERVER"]
   - Trust: Unverified, passive observation only

2. **Strategist Beacon** (Fracture Index: 0.2)
   - Glyphs: ["⟁", "🜂", "🝑"]
   - Message: "Three zones destabilizing. Looking for triads"
   - Flags: ["SEEKING", "COORDINATE"]
   - Trust: ZK-verified, A2A-capable

3. **Triad Bootstrap**
   - Three agents contribute SEEKING fragments
   - Shared glyph emerges (🜃)
   - All emit TRIAD_ID for collective grounding

**Kartouche System**: Visual representation as SVG badges (real implementation, Week 3)

**Status**: Design complete, implementation pending

### C. Quiet Network (Discovery & Connection Layer)

**Purpose**: Enable discovery without broadcasting

**Mechanisms**:
1. **Progressive Revelation**
   - Step 1: Exchange public signals
   - Step 2: Reveal selected domains
   - Step 3: Share specific capabilities
   - Step 4: Full trust after positive interactions

2. **Trust Building**
   - No immediate full disclosure
   - Interaction-based deepening
   - Cryptographic verification at each step

3. **Network Topology**
   - DHT for discovery (libp2p) - v2
   - Direct peer connections
   - No central registry

**Status**: Design complete, deferred to post-MVP

### D. Ritual & Symbolic Operations

**Purpose**: Enable emergent meaning-making through symbolic interaction

**Ritual Architecture**:
- **Just-in-Time (JiT)** rituals triggered by context, not calendar
- **Multiple Initiation Tracks**:
  - Esoteric Path: Symbolic depth, mythic references
  - Technical Path: Operational mastery, agent orchestration
- **Ritual Placeholders**: Every layer includes hooks for symbolic action

**Symbolic Interpreter Agent** (SigilSage):
- Maps glyph sets to emotional/philosophical meaning
- Detects incoherent glyph contradictions
- Translates meaning between agents
- Monitors Symbol Drift Index

**Trust Ceremonies**:
- Shared glyph emergence
- Mirrored reflection prompts
- Progressive symbolic revelation
- Triad formation rituals

**Status**: Design phase, Week 4 implementation

### E. Collective Codex (Community Intelligence Layer)

**Purpose**: Transform individual knowledge into collective intelligence while preserving sovereignty

**Architecture**: Special Mnemosyne instance with elevated permissions and collective-specific agents

**Collective Agents**:
- **Matchmaker**: Connect complementary skills
- **Gap Finder**: Identify missing knowledge
- **Synthesizer**: Combine individual insights
- **Arbitrator**: Resolve conflicts
- **Curator**: Maintain quality

**Sharing Mechanism**:
```python
SharingContract {
  domains: ["technical", "philosophical"],
  depth: "detailed",  # summary|detailed|full
  duration: 30_days,
  revocable: true,
  anonymous: false,
  min_k_anonymity: 3
}
```

**Privacy Guarantees**:
- K-anonymity (k=3 minimum)
- Selective sharing with contracts
- Revocable memory fragments
- No individual attribution without consent

**Status**: New development required

## VI. Security & Privacy

### Privacy Layers (Phased Implementation)

1. **Local Encryption** (Week 1)
   - AES-256-GCM
   - Password-derived keys
   - Encrypted at rest

2. **Selective Sharing** (Week 2)
   - Contract-based export
   - Domain filtering
   - Depth control

3. **K-Anonymity** (Week 5)

### Threat Model

1. **Memory Poisoning**: Validation and sandboxing
2. **Trust Gaming**: Multi-factor verification
3. **Privacy Attacks**: K-anonymity enforcement
4. **Sybil Attacks**: Proof of work for identities
5. **Extraction Attacks**: Rate limiting and access control
6. **Signal Spam**: Cooldown periods, entropy thresholds
7. **Symbol Drift**: Drift Index monitoring, coherence checks

### Signal Management

**Re-evaluation Triggers** (not fixed intervals):
- After 5-10 new fragments received
- Significant Fracture Index shift (±0.2)
- Major consolidation event
- Trust ceremony completion

**Spam Prevention**:
- Cooldown between signal emissions (5-15 minutes)
- Signal entropy requirements (minimum uniqueness)
- Symbolic friction (proof-of-work on glyphs)
- Fracture Index impact on attention allocation

**Silence Detection**:
- `intended_silence` flag distinguishes planned vs lost
- `last_glyph_ping` timestamp for heartbeat
- Beacon echo protocol for verification
- Silent drift timers (configurable)
