# Synthetic ICV Validation Protocol
*Testing identity compression with artificial identities*

## Rationale

Before processing real human identities, validate ICV properties using synthetic data:
- No privacy concerns
- Controlled experimentation
- Rapid iteration possible
- Edge case exploration

## Synthetic Identity Generation

### Method 1: Persona-Based Generation
```python
class SyntheticIdentity:
    def __init__(self, archetype):
        self.archetype = archetype  # Explorer, Guardian, Creator, etc.
        self.values = generate_value_system(archetype)
        self.communication_style = generate_style(archetype)
        self.behavioral_patterns = generate_behaviors(archetype)
        self.temporal_evolution = generate_history()
```

### Method 2: Statistical Generation
- Sample from personality distributions
- Generate consistent behavioral traces
- Create plausible interaction histories
- Ensure internal coherence

### Method 3: Hybrid Real-Synthetic
- Start with anonymized real patterns
- Introduce controlled variations
- Maintain statistical properties
- Remove identifying information

## Validation Dimensions

### 1. Holographic Properties
Each ICV fragment should contain essence of whole:
```python
def test_holographic(full_icv):
    fragments = split_into_parts(full_icv, n=12)
    for fragment in fragments:
        reconstructed = reconstruct_from_fragment(fragment)
        similarity = measure_similarity(reconstructed, full_icv)
        assert similarity > 0.7  # Each part contains 70% of whole
```

### 2. Temporal Stability (70/30 Model)
```python
def test_temporal_stability(identity, time_periods=10):
    icv_sequence = []
    for t in range(time_periods):
        identity.evolve(time_step=t)
        icv = compress_identity(identity)
        icv_sequence.append(icv)
    
    core_stability = measure_core_preservation(icv_sequence)
    assert 0.65 < core_stability < 0.75  # ~70% stable
    
    adaptive_change = measure_adaptive_portion(icv_sequence)
    assert 0.25 < adaptive_change < 0.35  # ~30% adaptive
```

### 3. Compression Efficiency
- Target: 100-128 bits per identity
- Maintain 80% mutual information
- Reversible to meaningful features
- Unique per individual (collision rate < 0.001)

### 4. Privacy Preservation
```python
def test_privacy(icv):
    # Cannot extract raw personal data
    assert not can_extract_pii(icv)
    
    # Cannot reverse to original texts
    assert not can_reconstruct_source(icv)
    
    # Can still perform matching
    assert can_match_identity(icv)
```
