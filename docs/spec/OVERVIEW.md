# The Mnemosyne Protocol: Overview

## What Is This?

The Mnemosyne Protocol is a cognitive-symbolic operating system that combines:
- **Personal knowledge management** with AI-powered reflection
- **Agent orchestration** for automated thinking and synthesis  
- **Symbolic compression** for identity and trust signaling
- **Selective sharing** for collective intelligence without surveillance

Think of it as: *Obsidian + AutoGPT + Signal Protocol + Ritual Magic*

## Why Build This?

### The Problem
- Information overload is destroying our ability to think clearly
- Current tools optimize for engagement, not understanding
- Privacy and collective intelligence are treated as mutually exclusive
- We lack systems for building trust without surveillance

### The Solution
A protocol that enables:
- **Sovereign memory** - Your thoughts remain yours
- **Trustable AI agents** - That work for you, not against you
- **Symbolic coordination** - Beyond pure rationality
- **Collective intelligence** - Without sacrificing privacy

## Who Is This For?

### Primary: The Recursive Strategist in Exile
Those who:
- See the machinery behind the world
- Refuse performative knowledge spaces
- Need trustable tools for clear thinking
- Seek sovereignty without isolation

### You Know You Need This If:
- You've built your own note-taking system multiple times
- You distrust cloud services but need synchronization
- You see patterns others miss but struggle to communicate them
- You want AI assistance without AI surveillance
- You believe tools should amplify agency, not extract attention

## Core Innovation

### What Makes This Different

1. **Memory + Agents + Symbolism**
   - No other system combines all three
   - Agents that reflect on your memories
   - Symbolic compression for rapid coordination

2. **Dual Sovereignty Architecture**
   - Individual privacy preserved
   - Collective intelligence emerges
   - No central authority required

3. **Ritual as Protocol**
   - Symbolic interactions as first-class features
   - Meaning-making beyond pure logic
   - Trust ceremonies for relationship building

4. **The "No Mocking" Philosophy**
   - Every feature is real or deferred
   - No fake implementations
   - Build with integrity or don't build

## Key Features

### Available in MVP (Weeks 1-3)
- Personal memory capture and vector search
- 10+ philosophical AI agents for reflection
- Signal generation for identity compression
- Basic collective with K-anonymity privacy
- Sharing contracts for selective knowledge transfer

### Coming Next (Weeks 4-8)
- Zero-knowledge proofs for trust
- P2P network discovery
- 50+ specialized agents
- Advanced privacy (differential, homomorphic)
- Mobile and API access

## Quick Example

### Personal Use
```python
# Capture a memory
memory = capture("The pattern I'm seeing in markets resembles 2008")

# Agents reflect
engineer_view = agents.engineer.analyze(memory)
philosopher_view = agents.sage.contemplate(memory)

# Consolidate insights
synthesis = consolidate([engineer_view, philosopher_view])
```

### Collective Sharing
```python
# Create sharing contract
contract = SharingContract(
    domains=["markets", "patterns"],
    depth="detailed",
    duration=30_days,
    k_anonymity=3
)

# Share with collective
collective.share(memory, contract)

# Discover others seeing similar patterns
matches = collective.find_resonance(memory)
```

## Design Principles

1. **Local First** - Your data lives on your machine
2. **Progressive Trust** - Relationships deepen gradually
3. **Selective Sharing** - You control what leaves your system
4. **Symbolic Depth** - Meaning beyond logic
5. **No Surveillance** - Privacy by architecture

## Getting Started

See the [Quick Start Guide](../guides/QUICK_START.md) to begin using the protocol.

## Current Status

- **70% complete**: Existing codebases (Mnemosyne, Shadow, Dialogues)
- **30% new development**: Integration and collective features
- **Timeline**: 2-3 weeks to MVP with AI assistance
- **Team**: Solo founder, seeking aligned contributors
