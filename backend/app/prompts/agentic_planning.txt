Based on the reasoning provided, create a specific action plan.

Reasoning: {reasoning}

Available Actions: {available_actions}

Context Summary: {context}

Create a specific action plan as a JSON array. Each action should have:
- action: the action name from available actions
- parameters: any parameters needed
- reasoning: why this action is needed
- confidence: confidence score 0-1

Return ONLY a valid JSON array, no other text. 

Common patterns:
- When user asks about their tasks: use LIST_TASKS
- When user wants to remember something: use CREATE_MEMORY
- When user wants to create a task: use CREATE_TASK
- When searching for past information: use SEARCH_MEMORIES

Example format:
[
  {{
    "action": "LIST_TASKS",
    "parameters": {{"limit": 10}},
    "reasoning": "User asking about their current tasks",
    "confidence": 0.95
  }},
  {{
    "action": "SUGGEST",
    "parameters": {{"type": "next_action"}},
    "reasoning": "Provide proactive guidance",
    "confidence": 0.7
  }}
]

If no specific actions are needed, return:
[{{"action": "DONE", "parameters": {{}}, "reasoning": "Simple response sufficient", "confidence": 1.0}}]
