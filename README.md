# The Mnemosyne Protocol

**Individual Sovereignty â†’ Collective Intelligence â†’ Emergent Order**

## ðŸš€ Quick Start

```bash
# Clone and setup
git clone [repository-url] mnemosyne-protocol
cd mnemosyne-protocol

# Run setup script
./scripts/setup.sh

# Configure environment
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your API keys

# Start all services
docker-compose up

# Access the application
open http://localhost:3000
```

## What Is This?

A cognitive-symbolic operating system for navigating civilizational phase transition. The Mnemosyne Protocol creates both personal cognitive sovereignty and collective intelligence while preserving privacy and autonomy.

- **[Task Tracking](TASK_TRACKING.md)** - Development roadmap and tasks

## Visual Examples

The protocol includes a visual identity system (kartouches) for symbolic representation:

- [Kartouche Example 1](kartouche1.png) - Egyptian-style symbolic encoding
- [Kartouche Example 2](kartouche2.png) - Circular orbital design
- [Kartouche Example 3](kartouche3.svg) - SVG implementation

## For Different Audiences

### If You're a Developer
1. Read the [Overview](OVERVIEW.md)
2. Review [Implementation Design](IMPLEMENTATION_DESIGN.md)
3. Pick tasks from [Task Tracking](TASK_TRACKING.md)
4. Check existing code in related projects

### If You're a Community Leader
1. Start with the [Overview](OVERVIEW.md)
2. Focus on Collective Codex sections in the [Specification](MNEMOSYNE_PROTOCOL_SPECIFICATION_v2.md)
3. Consider your community's coordination needs

## Project Status

- **Phase**: Active Development
- **Completion**: ~35% (leveraging existing codebases)
- **Timeline**: 8-10 weeks to MVP
- **Existing Code**: 
  - [Mnemosyne](../mnemosyne) - Memory engine (70% complete)
  - [Shadow](../shadow) - Agent orchestration
  - [Dialogues](../dialogues) - Philosophical agents
  - [Chatter](../chatter) - Framework patterns

## Core Components

1. **Mnemosyne Engine** - Personal memory and cognition
2. **Deep Signal Protocol** - Symbolic identity and trust
3. **Quiet Network** - Peer discovery and connection
4. **Collective Codex** - Community intelligence and coordination

## Philosophy

> "Not about building a new temple, but recovering the symbols from the old ones, distilling them, and translating them into tools."

This protocol serves those who:
- See the machinery behind the world
- Refuse performative knowledge spaces
- Seek trustable cognition without spectacle
- Want to preserve what makes us human

## Contributing

See [Task Tracking](TASK_TRACKING.md) for specific development tasks. The project needs:
- Core developers (Python/TypeScript)
- Frontend developers (React/Vue)
- Security auditors
- Early testers and community builders

## License

Will be fully open source (MIT or Apache 2.0) upon release.
