This product includes software developed for The Mnemosyne Protocol
(https://github.com/ldgeorge85/Mnemosyne).

ATTRIBUTION NOTICE
================================================================================

The Mnemosyne Protocol is a research project exploring new primitives for
cognitive sovereignty - mechanisms for preserving human agency in the age of
surveillance capitalism.

This is NOT a commercial product but a research initiative creating patterns
and primitives that others can build upon. The goal is to enable forms of
digital existence that preserve human agency against corporate aggregation.

Key Innovations:
- Trust Without Central Authority: Enabling binding agreements between hostile
  parties without blockchain or central servers
- Cryptographic Receipts: Transparency primitives with SHA-256 hash chains
- Identity Compression Vectors: Conceptual framework for portable identity
- Philosophical Personas: AI alignment without lobotomization

When using or building upon this work, please acknowledge The Mnemosyne Protocol
and its mission to create new categories of resistance through novel primitives.
