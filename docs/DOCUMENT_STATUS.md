# Document Status & Organization
*Last Updated: August 24, 2025*

## Primary Documents (Current & Authoritative)

### Core Vision & Strategy
- **MNEMOSYNE_PRIMER.md** - Public-facing introduction to the project
- **INTEGRATED_VISION_2025.md** - Comprehensive strategic vision and path
- **ROADMAP_2025.md** - Phased development plan (UPDATED with correct priorities)
- **IMMEDIATE_TASKS.md** - Current sprint tasks (UPDATED to maintain core focus)

### Technical Guidance
- **AI_DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md** - Instructions for AI assistants working on project
- **CONTRIBUTING.md** - Contribution guidelines
- **CONCEPTS_DEEP_DIVE.md** - Technical concepts explained

### New Integration Documents
- **MULTIMODAL_INTEGRATION.md** - How multimodal SUPPORTS core vision (not replaces)
- **MULTIMODAL_AGENT_STRATEGY.md** - Technical strategy for multi-agent systems

### Status Reports
- **SECURITY_ACTIVATION_LOG.md** - Security phase completion record

## Specialized Directories

### /spec
Protocol specifications and persona/worldview design

### /research  
Active research tracks including:
- **CONTEXTUAL_PRESENTATION.md** - Replaces multi-tier legibility
- **SYNTHETIC_ICV_VALIDATION.md** - Identity compression research
- **MULTI_AGENT_ARCHITECTURE.md** - Agent orchestration patterns

### /philosophy
Core philosophical principles

### /decisions
Architectural decision records

### /aimc
AI-mediated communication research (theoretical)

## Recently Reorganized

The following documents have been superseded or consolidated:
- **WORLDVIEW_SYNTHESIS_V2.md** - Superseded by internal documentation
- **VISION_UPDATE_MULTIMODAL.md** - Replaced by MULTIMODAL_INTEGRATION.md
- **PHASE_1E_PROGRESS_REPORT.md** - Old progress report, no longer current
- **IMPLEMENTATION_PRIORITIES_MULTIMODAL.md** - Replaced by integration approach

## Key Clarifications

### Priority Order (Corrected)
1. **Persona & Worldview System** - Core sovereignty interface
2. **ICV Validation Research** - Theoretical foundation
3. **Trust Networks** - The actual innovation
4. **Multimodal Support** - Enhances above (not primary focus)

### Model Approach (Clarified)
- We provide orchestration infrastructure
- Users provide/configure AI endpoints
- We are model-agnostic
- No promises of "owning models"

### What Stays Internal
- Liberation infrastructure details
- Advanced philosophical frameworks
- Strategic alignment aspects

## Document Maintenance Rules

1. **One source of truth** - No duplicate/conflicting information
2. **Clear supersession** - Remove outdated versions
3. **Explicit status** - Mark DRAFT/THEORETICAL/PROVEN
4. **Regular cleanup** - Keep only current documentation

## Current Conflicts: NONE

All conflicting documents have been archived. The remaining documents present a consistent vision where:
- Core mission is cognitive sovereignty through trust networks
- Multimodal capabilities support but don't replace core features
- We orchestrate user-provided AI endpoints, not provide models
- Priority remains on persona, ICV, and trust networks
