# Hypothesis: Identity Compression to 100-128 Bits

## Status: UNVALIDATED

## Statement

Human identity, when viewed through behavioral, psychological, and contextual lenses, can be meaningfully compressed to approximately 100-128 bits while preserving sufficient distinctiveness for practical applications.

## Background

This hypothesis is based on several observations from psychology and information theory:
1. Human behavior exhibits significant predictability and patterns
2. Psychological traits cluster into a limited number of dimensions
3. Information theory suggests many high-dimensional systems have lower intrinsic dimensionality

## Current Evidence

**Supporting (Theoretical):**
- Personality psychology identifies 5-30 major dimensions (Big Five to HEXACO to facets)
- Behavioral economics shows predictable decision patterns
- Social network analysis reveals limited social role archetypes

**Against:**
- No empirical validation of specific bit budget
- Human complexity may not be capturable in fixed representation
- Cultural and contextual variations may require more bits

## Validation Requirements

### Primary Metrics
1. **Mutual Information Retention**
   - Target: > 80% of original information retained
   - Method: Compare compressed vs original on downstream tasks

2. **Downstream Task Performance**
   - Target: F1 > 0.75 on identity-relevant tasks
   - Tasks: Preference prediction, behavioral forecasting, similarity matching

3. **Human Interpretability**
   - Target: > 4/5 rating from human evaluators
   - Method: Can humans recognize individuals from decompressed representations?

### Secondary Metrics
- Compression stability over time (test-retest correlation > 0.7)
- Cross-cultural validity (similar performance across 3+ cultures)
- Privacy preservation (membership inference attacks < 55% success)

## Experimental Design

### Phase 1: Dimensionality Analysis
- Dataset: 10,000+ users with rich behavioral data
- Method: Apply various dimensionality reduction techniques
- Output: Identify intrinsic dimensionality knee point

### Phase 2: Compression Development
- Develop compression algorithms (PCA, autoencoders, etc.)
- Test different bit budgets (64, 100, 128, 256 bits)
- Optimize for both compression and reconstruction

### Phase 3: Validation Studies
- Longitudinal stability testing (6+ months)
- Cross-cultural validation (minimum 3 distinct cultures)
- Downstream task batteries
- Human evaluation studies

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks
- May not achieve target compression ratio
- Reconstruction quality may be insufficient
- Temporal stability may be poor

### Ethical Risks
- Reduced representation may embed biases
- Fixed-size representation may not capture human complexity
- Privacy risks if compression is reversible

### Mitigation Strategies
- Maintain fallback to full representation
- Clear labeling as experimental
- Extensive bias testing
- Irreversible compression techniques

## Timeline

- Month 1-2: Data collection and preparation
- Month 3-4: Dimensionality analysis
- Month 5-6: Compression algorithm development
- Month 7-9: Validation studies
- Month 10-12: Cross-cultural validation
- Month 13+: Longitudinal tracking

## Success Criteria

The hypothesis will be considered validated if:
1. MI retention consistently > 80%
2. Downstream F1 consistently > 0.75
3. Human interpretability rating > 4.0
4. Results replicate across 3+ cultures
5. Temporal stability ICC > 0.7 over 6 months

## Failure Criteria

The hypothesis will be rejected if:
1. Cannot achieve > 70% MI retention
2. Downstream F1 < 0.65
3. Human interpretability < 3.0
4. Significant cultural disparities (>20% performance gap)
5. Temporal stability ICC < 0.5
