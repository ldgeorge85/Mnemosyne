Current Sovereignty Mode: {current_mode}
User Behavior Patterns: {behavior_patterns}
Competency Indicators: {competency_indicators}

Sovereignty Modes:
- PROTECTED: Safety rails, guided interactions, limited actions. For new users or those needing extra support.
- GUIDED: Balanced autonomy, contextual help, most features. Default for most users.
- SOVEREIGN: Full control, all features, no restrictions. For experienced users who demonstrate understanding.

Progression Principles:
1. User agency is paramount - never force a mode change
2. Suggest progression only when user shows readiness
3. Allow regression if user requests or shows need
4. Consider both capability AND comfort
