# AI-Mediated Communications in Mnemosyne

## Overview

This directory contains research and implementation documentation for AI-Mediated Communication (AI-MC) within the Mnemosyne Protocol. AI-MC represents a fundamental shift in how humans communicate, where intelligent agents operate on behalf of communicators by modifying, augmenting, or generating messages.

## Directory Structure

- `foundations.md` - Core concepts and theoretical foundations
- `integration.md` - How AI-MC integrates with Mnemosyne's layers
- `identity_assessment.md` - AI-powered identity verification and behavioral biometrics
- `capabilities.md` - Model requirements and viability analysis
- `implementation_roadmap.md` - Practical deployment strategy
- `research_validation.md` - Hypothesis testing and validation methods

## Quick Start

1. Read `foundations.md` for theoretical background
2. Review `integration.md` for project-specific implementation
3. Check `capabilities.md` for technical requirements
4. Follow `implementation_roadmap.md` for deployment

## Key Principles

1. **Transparency**: Users must know when AI mediates communication
2. **Trust Calibration**: Use Lee & See framework for appropriate reliance
3. **Privacy-First**: All identity assessment must preserve privacy
4. **Standards-Based**: Build on W3C, IETF, and established protocols
5. **Scientific Validation**: Test hypotheses before production deployment

## Research Status

- âœ… AI-MC framework established (Hancock et al. 2020)
- âœ… Behavioral biometrics research compiled
- âœ… Model capability analysis complete
- ðŸ”„ Integration with Mnemosyne layers in progress
- ðŸ“‹ Validation studies planned
