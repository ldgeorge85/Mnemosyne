# P2P Trust Architecture: Consistency Review
*Status of all specifications and their relationships*

## Document Status & Relationships

### Core Specifications (All Current & Consistent)

#### 1. MULTI_PARTY_NEGOTIATION.md ✅
- **Status**: Valid for single-instance deployments
- **Scope**: Negotiation within one database
- **Completeness**: 75% implemented
- **Next Steps**: Add digital signatures, fix user ID handling

#### 2. NEGOTIATION_P2P_EXTENSION.md ✅ (NEW)
- **Status**: Extends #1 for cross-instance negotiation
- **Scope**: Bridges single-instance to P2P
- **Relationship**: Backwards compatible with #1
- **Key Addition**: Distributed consensus, message broadcasting

#### 3. ROADMAP_P2P_TRUST.md ✅
- **Status**: Master plan for P2P evolution
- **Scope**: Q1 2025 - Q4 2026 implementation
- **Relationships**: Orchestrates all other specs
- **Key Phases**: Protocol → Identity → Negotiation → Network → Scale

#### 4. ICV_TRUST_INTEGRATION.md ✅
- **Status**: Complete specification for identity system
- **Scope**: 128-dimensional identity vectors
- **Relationships**:
  - Enables user verification in #2
  - Provides identity for #5 routing
  - Foundation for #6 dual-layer

#### 5. ROUTING_DISCOVERY_PROTOCOL.md ✅
- **Status**: Network formation specification
- **Scope**: Instance discovery and message routing
- **Relationships**:
  - Routes messages for #2
  - Uses ICVs from #4 for trust paths
  - Supports both instance types from #6

#### 6. DUAL_LAYER_IDENTITY.md ✅
- **Status**: Instance vs User identity separation
- **Scope**: Multi-user instances, migration
- **Relationships**:
  - Extends #4 with instance identity
  - Enables mixed-mode in #2
  - Provides migration for #5 network

## Architecture Layers

```
Application Layer
├── Multi-Party Negotiation (#1)
└── P2P Extension (#2)

Identity Layer
├── ICV System (#4)
└── Dual-Layer Identity (#6)

Network Layer
├── Routing & Discovery (#5)
└── Message Transport

Trust Layer
├── Single-Instance Trust (#1)
└── P2P Trust Network (#3)
```

## Consistency Verification

### ✅ User Identification
- Single-instance: `user_id` (UUID)
- P2P: `user_id@instance_id`
- Migration: Identity portable across instances
- **Consistent**: All specs use same notation

### ✅ Trust Establishment
- Single-instance: Direct database lookup
- P2P: ICV exchange + instance verification
- Mixed-mode: Instance trust × User trust
- **Consistent**: Layered approach works

### ✅ Message Protocol
- Format defined in ROADMAP (#3)
- Used by P2P Extension (#2)
- Routed by Discovery (#5)
- **Consistent**: Same protocol throughout

### ✅ Consensus Mechanism
- Single-instance: Database state check
- P2P: Distributed consensus with Merkle proofs
- Verification: Third-party can verify
- **Consistent**: P2P extends single-instance

### ✅ Identity System
- ICV: 128-dimensional vectors (#4)
- Scoped disclosure: Progressive trust
- Instance identity: Aggregate or single (#6)
- **Consistent**: Unified identity model

## Implementation Path

### Current State (Working)
```
Single Mnemosyne Instance
├── Multiple users (shared DB)
├── Negotiations table
├── Direct consensus
└── 75% complete
```

### Phase 1: P2P Foundation (Q1 2025)
```
Instance A ←→ Instance B
├── Message protocol
├── Digital signatures
├── Instance cards
└── Direct peering
```

### Phase 2: Identity Layer (Q2 2025)
```
User@Instance notation
├── ICV implementation
├── Trust web
├── Migration protocol
└── Scoped disclosure
```

### Phase 3: Full P2P (Q3 2025)
```
Trust Network
├── Multi-hop routing
├── Distributed negotiations
├── Third-party verification
└── Arbiter/escrow roles
```

## Compatibility Guarantees

| Feature | Single-Instance | P2P | Mixed-Mode |
|---------|----------------|-----|------------|
| User auth | ✅ JWT | ✅ ICV + Keys | ✅ Both |
| Negotiation | ✅ Local DB | ✅ Distributed | ✅ Auto-detect |
| Trust scores | ✅ Database | ✅ Trust web | ✅ Combined |
| Migration | N/A | ✅ Full | ✅ Full |
| Verification | ✅ API | ✅ Merkle | ✅ Both |

## Key Architectural Decisions (Confirmed)

1. **Backwards Compatible**: Single-instance keeps working
2. **Progressive Enhancement**: P2P features are additive
3. **User Sovereignty**: Identity always portable
4. **Instance Flexibility**: Personal to community scale
5. **Trust Gradualism**: Zero initial trust, earned over time

## Missing Pieces (Still Needed)

### Technical
- [ ] Ed25519 signature implementation
- [ ] Vector clock implementation
- [ ] Merkle tree utilities
- [ ] Message queue for P2P

### Specifications
- [ ] Backup/recovery protocol
- [ ] Instance reputation aggregation
- [ ] Advanced dispute resolution
- [ ] Performance optimization guide

## Validation Checklist

- ✅ All specs reference consistent data models
- ✅ User identification scheme is uniform
- ✅ Trust calculations are compatible
- ✅ Migration path is clear
- ✅ P2P extends (not replaces) single-instance
- ✅ Identity system supports all scenarios
- ✅ Routing works for all deployment types
- ✅ No conflicts in API endpoints

## Conclusion

All specifications are **current, consistent, and complementary**:

1. **MULTI_PARTY_NEGOTIATION.md** - Valid, works today for single-instance
2. **NEGOTIATION_P2P_EXTENSION.md** - Bridges to P2P, backwards compatible
3. **ROADMAP_P2P_TRUST.md** - Master plan, guides implementation
4. **ICV_TRUST_INTEGRATION.md** - Identity foundation, enables verification
5. **ROUTING_DISCOVERY_PROTOCOL.md** - Network formation, connects instances
6. **DUAL_LAYER_IDENTITY.md** - Flexible deployment, identity portability

The architecture supports everything from a single-user personal instance to a massive federated network, always maintaining user sovereignty and trust principles.
