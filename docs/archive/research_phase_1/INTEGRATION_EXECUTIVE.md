## Risk Mitigation Strategy

### Technical Risks

**MLS Scalability**
- Mitigation: Early benchmarking, Signal fallback ready

**Cultural Bias**
- Mitigation: Early diverse testing, multiple consultants
- Decision point: Week 10

### Process Risks

**Scope Creep**
- Mitigation: Strict phase gates, defer nice-to-haves
- Review: Weekly

**Technical Debt**
- Mitigation: Refactoring sprints, code review standards
- Review: Bi-weekly

**Team Burnout**
- Mitigation: Sustainable pace, celebration milestones
- Review: Continuous

---

## Resource Allocation

### Budget Distribution (4 months)
- Engineering salaries: 60%
- Infrastructure/tools: 15%
- Security audit: 15%
- Consultants: 10%

### Team Ramp
