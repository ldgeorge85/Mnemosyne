## Recommendation

We've made excellent progress, going much deeper than the original sprint planned. We should:

1. **Continue with Evolution Operators** (next logical step)
2. **Then tackle MLS analysis** (critical technical decision)
3. **Then formalize Resonance Mechanics** (enables collective features)

The research is revealing a coherent system that's more sophisticated than originally envisioned, with strong mathematical foundations and practical implementation paths.
