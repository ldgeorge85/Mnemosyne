# Hypothesis: 70/30 Behavioral Stability

## Status: UNVALIDATED

## Hypothesis Statement

Human cognitive patterns exhibit a 70/30 stability ratio where approximately 70% of behavioral patterns remain stable over time while 30% adapt to new contexts and experiences.

## Background

This hypothesis emerged from informal observations but lacks rigorous empirical validation. The specific 70/30 ratio is currently speculative.

## Proposed Validation Method

### Metrics to Collect
1. **Pattern Stability Index (PSI)**
   - Track user interaction patterns over time
   - Measure consistency in memory categorization
   - Monitor agent interaction preferences

2. **Behavioral Drift Rate**
   - Quantify changes in user behavior weekly
   - Identify which behaviors remain stable
   - Measure adaptation to new features

3. **Cognitive Load Indicators**
   - Response time variations
   - Error rates in predictions
   - User satisfaction scores

### Data Requirements
- Minimum 1000 users
- 6-month observation period
- Consent for behavioral tracking
- Anonymized pattern analysis

## Validation Criteria

### Success Metrics
- Stability ratio within 65-75% range (allowing for variance)
- Statistical significance p < 0.05
- Reproducible across user segments
- Cohen's d > 0.3 effect size

### Failure Conditions
- Ratio outside 65-75% range
- High variance between user groups
- Unable to achieve statistical significance
- Privacy concerns raised

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Instrumentation
```python
class BehavioralTracker:
    async def track_pattern(self, user_id: str, action: Dict):
        # Anonymize and aggregate
        pattern = self.extract_pattern(action)
        await self.store_with_consent(user_id, pattern)
```

### Phase 2: Analysis
```python
def calculate_stability_ratio(patterns: List[Pattern]) -> float:
    stable = count_stable_patterns(patterns)
    total = len(patterns)
    return stable / total
```

### Phase 3: Validation
- Compare predicted vs actual behavior
- Measure prediction accuracy
- Validate across cohorts

## Ethical Considerations

### Privacy Protection
- Differential privacy with Îµ = 1.0
- K-anonymity minimum of 5
- No individual behavior tracking
- Aggregate patterns only

### Consent Requirements
- Explicit opt-in required
- Clear explanation of tracking
- Right to delete data
- Regular consent renewal

## Current Evidence

### Supporting (Weak)
- Informal user feedback suggests pattern consistency
- Similar ratios observed in habit formation research
- Cognitive psychology literature on behavioral stability

### Contradicting
- Individual variance may be too high
- Cultural differences not accounted for
- Digital behavior may differ from general behavior

## Risks

1. **Overgeneralization**: 70/30 may not apply universally
2. **Privacy Concerns**: Behavioral tracking sensitivity
3. **Confirmation Bias**: Risk of seeing patterns that don't exist
4. **User Trust**: May damage trust if hypothesis fails

## Alternative Hypotheses

1. **Dynamic Ratio**: Stability ratio varies by individual (60-80% range)
2. **Context-Dependent**: Ratio changes based on domain
3. **Time-Variant**: Stability increases over time (learning effect)
4. **No Fixed Ratio**: Behavioral patterns too complex for simple ratio

## Next Steps

1. Implement anonymized tracking system
2. Design consent flow with clear explanations
3. Establish baseline measurements
4. Run 3-month pilot study
5. Publish interim results
6. Adjust hypothesis based on evidence
