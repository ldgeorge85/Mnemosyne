## Implementation Order

### Immediate Priority
1. Phase 1: Complete persona and worldview integration
2. Phase 1.5: Synthetic ICV validation studies
3. Phase 2: Trust network protocols

### Parallel Research Track
- ICV validation studies
- Trust protocol testing
- Resonance correlation analysis

### Conditional Development
- Only implement theoretical features after validation
- Maintain fallback strategies
- Build on proven foundations

### Decision Gates
Between phases, evaluate:
- Did research validation succeed?
- Are users finding value?
- Should we pivot or proceed?

## Critical Dependencies

The theoretical concepts have cascading dependencies:
```
Identity Compression (ICV)
    ‚Üì enables
Progressive Trust Exchange
    ‚Üì enables  
Resonance Compatibility
    ‚Üì enables
Agent Communication
    ‚Üì enables
Collective Intelligence
```

If ICV validation fails, the entire theoretical stack must be reconsidered.

## Next Actions

1. Complete Phase 1 core features (persona, worldview)
2. Begin synthetic ICV validation studies
3. Start trust network protocol design
4. Make go/no-go decisions based on validation results
