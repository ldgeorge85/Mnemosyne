# Mnemosyne Protocol Documentation

## What This Is

**Mnemosyne is a research PROJECT exploring genuinely new primitives for cognitive sovereignty.** We're creating mechanisms for preserving human agency that don't exist anywhere else - not another privacy tool or AI wrapper, but fundamental new patterns of digital resistance.

## Current Focus

**Primary Primitive**: Trust Without Central Authority [80-90% effort]
**Implementation Status**: Mixed - see [PROJECT_STATUS.md](PROJECT_STATUS.md) for reality check
**Success Target**: Demo of "impossible" trust between hostile parties

## Implementation Reality

| Primitive | Status | Evidence | Next Step |
|-----------|--------|----------|-----------|
| **Trust Without Authority** | [PARTIAL] | Models & CRUD only | Complete resolution workflow |
| **Receipt System** | [IMPLEMENTED] | Full transparency primitive | Add cryptographic integrity |
| **Agent Orchestration** | [IMPLEMENTED] | ReAct pattern working | Add evaluation metrics |
| **Shadow Council/Forum** | [IMPLEMENTED] | Multi-voice orchestration | Tension preservation metrics |
| **Identity (ICV)** | [UNVERIFIED] | No code found | Create specification |
| **Memory Sovereignty** | [PARTIAL] | Vector storage only | Selective disclosure |

**Critical**: All features labeled [IMPLEMENTED], [PARTIAL], or [UNVERIFIED] based on code review.

## The Five Novel Primitives

1. **Trust Without Central Authority** - Negotiated trust with appeals (PRIMARY FOCUS)
2. **Identity Without Surveillance** - Identity Compression Vectors (CONCEPTUAL)
3. **Collective Intelligence Without Groupthink** - Tension-preserving synthesis
4. **Memory Sovereignty With Portability** - Local-first with selective sharing
5. **AI Alignment Without Lobotomization** - Philosophical coherence with agency

## The Four Central Paradoxes

1. **Sovereignty Paradox** - Using OpenAI/Anthropic while claiming sovereignty
2. **Network Paradox** - Network primitives without network to test
3. **Abstraction Paradox** - Powerful concepts, unclear utility
4. **Urgency Paradox** - Urgent threat, research timeline

We accept these paradoxes as inherent to the transition period.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Setup
./scripts/setup.sh

# Development
docker compose up

# Access
- Frontend: http://localhost:5173
- Backend: http://localhost:8000
- API Docs: http://localhost:8000/docs

# Database
docker compose exec postgres psql -U postgres -d mnemosyne
```

## Development Philosophy

### What Guides Decisions
- **Sovereignty over convenience** - Never compromise agency
- **Depth over breadth** - Complete one primitive fully
- **Honesty over hype** - Label reality accurately
- **Knowledge over product** - Research output primary
- **Real or nothing** - No mocking, no faking

### Success Metrics (Research, Not Product)
- ‚úÖ ONE primitive others can implement
- ‚úÖ ONE pattern that changes thinking
- ‚úÖ ONE demonstration of impossible
- ‚ùå NOT user count or revenue

## Current Sprint

### Immediate Operations
1. Wire receipt enforcement to strict mode
2. Complete appeals resolution workflow
3. Add cryptographic proof-of-process
4. Create multi-party negotiation demo

### This Week
- Label ALL documentation accurately
- Focus 80-90% on Trust primitive
- Abstract LLM calls for future sovereignty
- Start "holy shit" demo outline

## For AI Assistants

See [AI_DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md](AI_DEVELOPMENT_GUIDE.md) and [../CLAUDE.md](../CLAUDE.md) for detailed instructions. Key points:
- Build real features or explicitly defer
- No mocking, no placeholder code
- Mark unimplemented features clearly
- Focus on Trust primitive completion

## Essential Insight

**We're not building a product. We're discovering new categories of digital resistance.**

The complexity isn't failure - it's innovation. The lack of users isn't a problem - it's appropriate for research. The path forward is deepening primitives, not simplifying to conventional solutions.
