### 2. For Engineers
- **Implement standards**: Help complete W3C DID, OAuth, MLS implementations
- **Fix bugs**: Address issues in Track 1 production code
- **Write tests**: Increase test coverage (no mocks!)
- **Improve performance**: Optimize existing implementations

### 3. For Users
- **Test features**: Use Track 1 features and report issues
- **Provide feedback**: Share your experience and suggestions
- **Participate in studies**: Opt into Track 2 experiments (with consent)
- **Report bugs**: File detailed issue reports

### 4. For Reviewers
- **Code review**: Review pull requests for quality and standards compliance
- **Documentation review**: Ensure clarity and accuracy
- **Security review**: Identify potential vulnerabilities
- **Compliance review**: Check EU AI Act and regulatory alignment

## Development Process

### Setting Up Your Environment

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/mnemosyne.git
cd mnemosyne

# Run setup script
./scripts/setup.sh

# Start development environment
docker-compose up

# Run tests
docker-compose exec backend pytest
```

### Code Standards

#### Track 1 (Production) Requirements
- Use established standards (W3C, IETF, OpenID)
- Write real tests (no mocking)
- Include Model Cards for AI components
- Follow existing patterns in the codebase
- Ensure EU AI Act compliance

#### Track 2 (Experimental) Requirements
- Create hypothesis documentation in `docs/hypotheses/`
- Implement consent mechanisms
- Add "EXPERIMENTAL" warnings
- Include validation metrics
- Use the ExperimentalPlugin base class

### Making Changes

1. **Create a branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. **Make your changes**
   - Follow the existing code style
   - Add tests for new functionality
   - Update documentation as needed

3. **Test your changes**
   ```bash
   # Run tests
   docker-compose exec backend pytest
   
   # Check linting
   docker-compose exec backend ruff check .
   
   # Type checking
   docker-compose exec backend mypy .
   ```

4. **Commit with clear messages**
   ```bash
   git add -A
   git commit -m "feat: Add W3C PROV integration for data lineage"
   ```

5. **Push and create PR**
   ```bash
   git push -u origin feature/your-feature-name
   # Then create a pull request on GitHub
   ```

## Pull Request Guidelines

### PR Requirements
- Clear description of changes
- Link to related issues
- Tests for new functionality
- Documentation updates
- No breaking changes to Track 1 without discussion

### PR Template
```markdown
## Description
Brief description of changes

## Type of Change
- [ ] Bug fix (Track 1)
- [ ] New feature (Track 1)
- [ ] Experimental feature (Track 2)
- [ ] Documentation update

## Testing
- [ ] Tests pass locally
- [ ] New tests added
- [ ] No mocking used

## Compliance
- [ ] EU AI Act considerations addressed
- [ ] Model Cards updated if applicable
- [ ] Privacy implications reviewed
```

## Hypothesis Validation Process

For Track 2 experimental features:

1. **Document hypothesis** in `docs/hypotheses/`
2. **Define success criteria** with measurable metrics
3. **Implement as plugin** using ExperimentalPlugin base
4. **Add consent flow** for data collection
5. **Collect metrics** during usage
6. **Analyze results** against criteria
7. **Publish findings** (positive or negative)
8. **Graduate to Track 1** only if validated

## Priority Areas

### ðŸš¨ Urgent (Sprint 1C - Frontend)
- Connect React frontend to FastAPI backend
- Implement login and dashboard UI
- Wire up memory capture interface
- **This makes Mnemosyne usable!**

### High Priority
- Complete W3C PROV integration
- Implement MLS Protocol (Sprint 2A)
- Create transparency API endpoints
- Add WebAuthn/FIDO2 authentication

### Research Priorities
- Consent management system
- Behavioral stability tracking
- Identity compression validation
- Cross-cultural studies

## Communication

### Where to Get Help
- GitHub Issues: Bug reports and feature requests
- Discussions: General questions and ideas
- Documentation: Check `docs/` directory first

### Code of Conduct
- Be respectful and inclusive
- Focus on constructive criticism
- Assume good intentions
- Help others learn and grow

## Recognition

Contributors will be recognized in:
- Git commit history
- CONTRIBUTORS.md file
- Release notes
- Research publications (for validation studies)

## Important Notes

### No Mocking Policy
We build real features or explicitly defer them. No fake implementations or placeholder code.

### Scientific Integrity
- Only proven features in Track 1
- Clear hypothesis documentation for Track 2
- Transparent about limitations
- Publish both positive and negative results

### Privacy First
- Never compromise on privacy
- Formal guarantees over promises
- Local-first architecture
- Consent for all data collection

## Questions?

If you have questions about contributing:
1. Check existing documentation in `docs/`
2. Look at similar code in the codebase
3. Review test files for examples
4. Open a GitHub issue for discussion
