## Execution Flow

### Step 1: Query Reception
When `USE_TOOL` action triggers with `tool_name="forum_of_echoes"`:
```json
{
  "action": "USE_TOOL",
  "parameters": {
    "tool_name": "forum_of_echoes",
    "query": "What is the meaning of suffering?",
    "parameters": {}
  }
}
```

### Step 2: Forum Initialization (forum_of_echoes.py)

#### Voice Selection Algorithm
```python
def select_voices(query, max_voices=7):
    # Analyze query for philosophical themes
    themes = extract_themes(query)  # ["suffering", "meaning", "purpose"]
    
    # Always include core voices
    selected = ["Stoic", "Buddhist", "Existentialist", "Pragmatist", "Humanist"]
    
    # Add contextually relevant voices
    if "suffering" in themes:
        selected.extend(["Nietzschean", "Christian Mystic"])
    if "meaning" in themes:
        selected.extend(["Logotherapist", "Absurdist"])
    if "ethics" in themes:
        selected.extend(["Kantian", "Utilitarian"])
    
    return selected[:max_voices]
```

### Step 3: Multi-Voice Orchestration

#### Phase 1: Opening Statements (Parallel)
Each selected voice prepares an initial response:

```
Query: "What is the meaning of suffering?"
         ↓
    [Parallel Processing]
         ↓
┌──────────┬──────────┬──────────┬──────────┬──────────┬──────────┬──────────┐
│  Stoic   │ Buddhist │Existential│Pragmatist│ Humanist │Nietzschean│Christian│
├──────────┼──────────┼──────────┼──────────┼──────────┼──────────┼──────────┤
│Endurance │Liberation│Authentic │ Growth   │Compassion│ Power    │Redemption│
│& Virtue  │from Dukkha│ Living   │Through   │& Service │ Through  │ Through  │
│          │          │          │Challenge │          │ Struggle │ Faith    │
└──────────┴──────────┴──────────┴──────────┴──────────┴──────────┴──────────┘
```

**Example Internal Prompts:**

**Stoic Voice:**
```
You are a Stoic philosopher in the tradition of Marcus Aurelius.
Query: "What is the meaning of suffering?"
Respond with: wisdom about accepting what cannot be controlled,
finding virtue in adversity, and maintaining equanimity.
Keep response under 200 words.
```

**Buddhist Voice:**
```
You embody Buddhist wisdom from the Theravada and Mahayana traditions.
Query: "What is the meaning of suffering?"
Explain: the First Noble Truth, the nature of dukkha,
and the path to liberation through understanding.
Keep response under 200 words.
```

#### Phase 2: Dialogue Rounds (3 Iterations)

The voices engage in structured dialogue:

```python
for round in range(3):
    # Round 1: Initial positions
    # Round 2: Response to others' views
    # Round 3: Synthesis attempts
    
    for voice in selected_voices:
        if round == 1:
            response = voice.initial_statement(query)
        elif round == 2:
            response = voice.respond_to_others(other_statements)
        else:  # round 3
            response = voice.propose_synthesis(all_discussions)
```

**Dialogue Dynamics:**
- **Agreement Recognition**: Voices acknowledge shared ground
- **Respectful Disagreement**: Contrasts presented without hostility
- **Cross-Pollination**: Ideas from one tradition inform another
- **Emergent Insights**: New perspectives arising from dialogue

#### Phase 3: Weaving the Tapestry

A meta-orchestrator (the "Weaver") integrates all perspectives:

```python
class Weaver:
    def synthesize(self, voices_responses):
        # Identify common themes
        themes = extract_common_themes(voices_responses)
        
        # Map complementary perspectives
        complementary = find_complementary_pairs(voices_responses)
        
        # Highlight creative tensions
        tensions = identify_productive_disagreements(voices_responses)
        
        # Generate meta-insights
        insights = derive_emergent_wisdom(themes, complementary, tensions)
        
        return formatted_synthesis
```

### Step 4: Response Compilation

The final response structure:

```markdown
