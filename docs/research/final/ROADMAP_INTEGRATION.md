## Integration Strategy

### Approach: Enhance Existing Sprints + Add New Ones

Rather than restructuring everything, we'll:
1. **Enhance existing sprints** with research-validated approaches
2. **Add 3 new sprints** for critical missing components
3. **Adjust timeline** to accommodate validation requirements

## Conclusion

The research findings integrate well with the existing sprint structure. By:
1. **Enhancing Sprints 4-6** with research components
2. **Adding Sprints 10-12** for crypto and validation
3. **Adjusting timeline** by 1-2 weeks
4. **Building validation framework** early

We can implement the research findings while maintaining the sprint momentum. The key is to add research-validated components without disrupting the working foundation already built.

**Recommended Action**: Continue with enhanced Sprint 4, incorporating compression and validation endpoints while maintaining the original API structure.
