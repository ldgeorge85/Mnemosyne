# Mnemosyne Protocol: Research Roadmap
*Order of Operations for New Primitive Development*

## Mission
Create new primitives for cognitive sovereignty that don't exist elsewhere. Enable forms of digital existence that preserve human agency against surveillance capitalism.

## Current State
Research PROJECT exploring genuinely new mechanisms. Not a product seeking users, but R&D creating patterns others can build upon.

## Order of Operations

### PHASE 4: Second Primitive Selection

#### Decision Gate: Which Primitive Next?
**Prerequisites**: Trust primitive complete, local sovereignty achieved

**Option A: Identity Without Surveillance (ICV)**
- Design Identity Compression Vector specification
- Build mathematical model
- Implement progressive disclosure
- Test privacy preservation
- Create portability protocol

**Option B: Collective Intelligence (Tension Preservation)**
- Formalize tension metrics
- Build disagreement persistence
- Create synthesis algorithms
- Test groupthink resistance
- Document emergence patterns

**Option C: Memory Sovereignty (Selective Disclosure)**
- Implement relationship-based ACLs
- Build cryptographic sharing
- Create portability protocol
- Test sovereignty guarantees
- Document ownership model

### PHASE 5: Ecosystem Seeding

#### Operation 1: Developer Enablement
**Prerequisites**: Two primitives complete
- [ ] Extract primitives as libraries
- [ ] Create developer documentation
- [ ] Build example applications
- [ ] Provide integration guides
- [ ] Support early adopters

#### Operation 2: Research Network
**Prerequisites**: Papers published
- [ ] Engage academic community
- [ ] Support derivative research
- [ ] Create collaboration framework
- [ ] Share datasets (privacy-preserved)
- [ ] Build citation network

### PHASE 6: Evaluation & Continuation

#### Decision Gate: Project Future
**Prerequisites**: Ecosystem seeding attempted

**Success Criteria Met**:
- External implementation exists
- Primitive adopted by others
- Research continued elsewhere
- Knowledge preserved
→ Document success and transition

**Partial Success**:
- Primitive works but not adopted
- Technical success, distribution failure
- Knowledge valuable but incomplete
→ Open source everything, write post-mortem

**Instructive Failure**:
- Primitive fundamentally flawed
- Assumptions proven wrong
- Valuable lessons learned
→ Document failure modes, enable next attempt

## Critical Dependencies

### Technical Requirements
- PostgreSQL, Redis, Qdrant operational
- Docker environment stable
- Development machine adequate

### Knowledge Requirements
- Cryptography fundamentals
- Distributed systems understanding
- Game theory basics
- Philosophy of sovereignty

### Resource Requirements
- Single researcher bandwidth
- No funding dependencies
- Open source tooling only
- Community goodwill

## Success Metrics

### Research Success (Not Product Metrics)
- ✅ ONE primitive complete and documented
- ✅ ONE external implementation
- ✅ ONE "impossible" thing demonstrated
- ✅ ONE paper accepted/cited
- ✅ Knowledge preserved for next attempt

### What We're NOT Measuring
- ❌ User count
- ❌ Revenue
- ❌ Market share
- ❌ Adoption rate
- ❌ Growth metrics

## Risk Register

### Accepted Risks
1. **Sovereignty Paradox** - Using surveillance tools during development
2. **Network Paradox** - Building network primitives alone
3. **Abstraction Paradox** - Complex concepts, unclear utility
4. **Urgency Paradox** - Long research, urgent threat

### Mitigation Strategies
1. **Documentation** - Everything recorded for others
2. **Simulation** - Synthetic environments for testing
3. **Demonstration** - Visceral proof of possibility
4. **Migration Path** - Clear route to sovereignty

## Guiding Principles

### What Guides Decisions
1. **Sovereignty over convenience** - Never compromise agency
2. **Depth over breadth** - Complete one thing fully
3. **Honesty over hype** - Label reality accurately
4. **Knowledge over product** - Research output primary
5. **Enable others** - Success = others building on this

### What We Reject
1. Simplifying away innovation
2. Chasing users before understanding
3. Hiding failures or limitations
4. Building conventional solutions
5. Accepting surveillance as inevitable

## Current Focus

**IMMEDIATE**: Complete Trust Without Central Authority primitive

**THIS OPERATION**:
1. Wire receipt enforcement to strict mode
2. Complete appeals resolution workflow
3. Add cryptographic proof-of-process

**SUCCESS LOOKS LIKE**: Demo of impossible trust - two hostile parties reach binding agreement with no central authority
