# AI-Mediated Communication: Protocol Integration
## Bridging AIMC with Identity Compression and Deep Signals

---

## Executive Summary

AI-Mediated Communication (AIMC) serves as both a **data collection mechanism** for identity compression and a **trust-building interface** for the Mnemosyne Protocol. This document maps how AIMC concepts integrate with Deep Signals, identity compression, and progressive trust establishment.

## Part I: AIMC as Identity Signal Generator

### Communication Patterns as Identity Markers

Every AI-mediated interaction generates behavioral signals that contribute to identity compression:

```python
class AIMCIdentityExtractor:
    """
    Extract identity signals from AI-mediated communications
    """
    
    def __init__(self):
        self.signal_dimensions = {
            'modification_preferences': [],    # How user modifies AI suggestions
            'acceptance_patterns': [],         # Which suggestions they accept
            'rejection_reasons': [],           # Why they reject suggestions
            'delegation_levels': [],           # What they let AI handle
            'control_boundaries': []           # Where they maintain control
        }
    
    async def extract_signals(self, interaction: AIMCInteraction) -> IdentitySignal:
        """
        Convert AIMC interaction into identity signal components
        """
        signals = {}
        
        # Extract behavioral patterns
        signals['autonomy_preference'] = self.measure_autonomy(interaction)
        signals['trust_calibration'] = self.measure_trust_response(interaction)
        signals['linguistic_fingerprint'] = self.extract_linguistic_pattern(interaction)
        signals['cognitive_load'] = self.estimate_cognitive_state(interaction)
        
        return IdentitySignal(
            raw_signals=signals,
            timestamp=interaction.timestamp,
            confidence=self.calculate_confidence(signals)
        )
    
    def measure_autonomy(self, interaction: AIMCInteraction) -> float:
        """
        Measure user's preference for AI autonomy vs control
        """
        # Track modification rate of AI suggestions
        modification_rate = interaction.edits / interaction.suggestions
        
        # Track delegation patterns
        delegation_score = sum([
            0.1 if interaction.level == 'augmentation',
            0.5 if interaction.level == 'modification',
            0.9 if interaction.level == 'generation'
        ])
        
        return (modification_rate * 0.6 + delegation_score * 0.4)
```

### Behavioral Biometrics Through AIMC

AIMC interactions reveal unique behavioral patterns:

#### 1. **Temporal Patterns**
```python
class TemporalSignature:
    def extract(self, aimc_history: List[AIMCInteraction]) -> np.ndarray:
        """
        Extract temporal behavior patterns
        """

            'edit_duration': [],             # Time spent editing AI content
            'delegation_timing': [],         # When they delegate to AI
            'review_patterns': [],           # How they review AI output
            'circadian_activity': []         # Time-of-day preferences
        }
        
        for interaction in aimc_history:
            patterns['response_latency'].append(
                interaction.user_response_time
            )
            patterns['edit_duration'].append(
                interaction.editing_duration
            )
            patterns['delegation_timing'].append(
                (interaction.timestamp.hour, interaction.delegation_level)
            )
        
        return self.vectorize_patterns(patterns)
```

#### 2. **Linguistic Fingerprints**
```python
class LinguisticIdentity:
    def analyze(self, modifications: List[TextModification]) -> Dict:
        """
        Analyze how user modifies AI-generated text
        """
        fingerprint = {
            'vocabulary_expansion': [],      # New words added
            'style_corrections': [],         # Style changes made
            'semantic_shifts': [],           # Meaning alterations
            'punctuation_habits': [],        # Punctuation changes
            'formality_adjustments': []      # Tone modifications
        }
        
        for mod in modifications:
            # Compare AI suggestion with user's final version
            diff = self.compute_diff(mod.ai_text, mod.user_text)
            
            fingerprint['vocabulary_expansion'].extend(
                self.extract_novel_vocabulary(diff)
            )
            fingerprint['style_corrections'].append(
                self.analyze_style_change(diff)
            )
            
        return fingerprint
```

## Part V: Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Data Collection Infrastructure
```python
# Implement AIMC interaction logging
class AIMCLogger:
    async def log_interaction(self, interaction: AIMCInteraction):
        # Store all AIMC interactions for analysis
        await self.db.store_interaction(interaction)
        
        # Extract immediate signals
        signals = await self.extract_signals(interaction)

## Conclusion

AIMC serves as the primary interface for:
1. **Collecting** behavioral signals for identity compression
2. **Building** trust through progressive AI mediation
3. **Validating** identity consistency through interaction patterns
4. **Preserving** privacy through differential privacy and ZK proofs

The integration creates a feedback loop where:
- AIMC generates identity signals
- Signals compress to Deep Signals
- Deep Signals enable trust establishment
- Trust levels determine AIMC mediation depth
- Deeper mediation generates richer signals

This symbiotic relationship between AIMC and identity compression forms the foundation for authentic, privacy-preserving digital identity in the Mnemosyne Protocol.
