## Conclusion

The AI-MC framework provides a treasure trove of proven standards and methodologies that directly address Mnemosyne's core challenges. By adopting these standards in Track 1, we gain immediate credibility and interoperability. By using them as validation frameworks in Track 2, we can rigorously test our hypotheses against established baselines.

The integration is not just beneficial—it's essential for:
1. **Regulatory compliance** (EU AI Act is already in force)
2. **Scientific validation** (using proven trust and privacy frameworks)
3. **Interoperability** (W3C standards for identity and provenance)
4. **User trust** (transparent calibration and Model Cards)

This positions Mnemosyne not as a speculative project but as a standards-compliant, scientifically-grounded implementation of next-generation AI-mediated communication.
