## Resource Requirements

### Human Resources
- **Now**: Solo founder (full-time)
- **Week 4**: + 1 contributor (part-time)
- **Month 3**: + 1 developer (full-time)
- **Month 6**: Team of 3-5

### Infrastructure Costs (Monthly)
- **MVP**: $20-50 (single server)
- **Beta**: $100-200 (multi-container)
- **Public**: $500-1000 (multi-region)
- **Scale**: $2000-5000 (global distribution)

### Funding Strategy
1. **Bootstrap** (Months 1-3)
2. **Donations/Patreon** (Month 4+)
3. **Grants** (Month 6+)
4. **Never**: VC funding

## Risk Management

### Technical Risks
- **Performance at scale**: Mitigate with caching, sharding
- **Security vulnerabilities**: Regular audits, bug bounties
- **Integration complexity**: Modular architecture

### Community Risks
- **Adoption resistance**: Focus on core users first
- **Governance disputes**: Clear principles from start
- **Mission drift**: Written philosophy, strong leadership

### Personal Risks
- **Burnout**: Sustainable pace, delegate early
- **Scope creep**: Strict MVP focus
- **Perfectionism**: Ship early, iterate often

---

## Success Metrics

## Principles

1. **Build for yourself first**
2. **Real implementation only**
3. **Privacy by architecture**
4. **Community over growth**
5. **Sovereignty over convenience**
