## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions

1. **Start with APIs** - Use OpenAI/Anthropic APIs for text generation
2. **Run local embeddings** - Use sentence-transformers locally
3. **Deploy LanguageTool** - Local grammar checking
4. **Collect interaction data** - Build dataset for research
5. **Use simple heuristics** - Don't pretend ML works where it doesn't

### Research Priorities

1. **Define success metrics** - What does "identity compression" even mean?
2. **Run small experiments** - Test if patterns are stable over time
3. **Publish negative results** - If compression doesn't work, document why
4. **Collaborate with academia** - This needs proper research

### Adjust Expectations

1. **Identity compression to 128 bits**: Likely impossible
2. **Behavioral pattern extraction**: Needs years of research
3. **Trust prediction**: Expect 60-70% accuracy at best
4. **Privacy + quality**: Must choose trade-offs

## Conclusion

The AIMC vision requires capabilities that **do not exist today**. We should:

1. Build MVP with proven technology (grammar, sentiment, generation)
2. Collect data to research feasibility
3. Adjust claims to match reality
4. Focus on valuable features that work today

The identity compression and deep signal extraction concepts are **theoretical research projects**, not implementable features. We need to separate the practical AIMC features (text improvement, sentiment analysis) from the speculative research (identity compression, trust dynamics).
