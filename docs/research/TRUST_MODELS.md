# Trust Models and Reputation Systems Research

## Executive Summary

Trust and reputation systems are critical for decentralized networks. Based on academic research from 2024-2025, we recommend a hybrid approach combining EigenTrust's mathematical elegance with flow-based trust metrics and symbolic verification ceremonies.

## Core Trust Algorithms

### EigenTrust (2003, Still Relevant in 2024)

**Mathematical Foundation**:
EigenTrust assigns each peer a unique global trust value based on their history, using distributed computation of eigenvector centrality in the trust graph.

**Key Properties**:
- **Global trust values**: Computed via power iteration
- **Sybil resistance**: Pre-trusted peers bootstrap the system
- **Transitivity**: Trust flows through the network
- **Proven effectiveness**: Reduces malicious content by 45-90% in simulations

**Implementation Formula**:
```
t(i+1) = (1-a) * C^T * t(i) + a * p
```
Where:
- C = normalized trust matrix
- p = pre-trusted peer vector
- a = dampening factor (typically 0.1-0.3)

**2024 Enhancement (EERP)**:
Enhanced EigenTrust with:
- Dynamic pre-trusted peer selection
- Adaptive dampening based on network volatility
- Multi-dimensional trust (content, behavior, consistency)

### Web of Trust (PGP Model)

**Principles**:
- **Direct verification**: Users personally verify identities
- **Trust signatures**: Cryptographic proof of verification
- **Trust levels**: Marginal, Full, Ultimate
- **No central authority**: Fully decentralized

**Mnemosyne Adaptation**:
```python
class TrustLevel(Enum):
    UNKNOWN = 0      # No verification
    MARGINAL = 1     # Single verification path
    FULL = 2         # Multiple verification paths
    ULTIMATE = 3     # Direct personal verification
    SYMBOLIC = 4     # Verified through ritual/ceremony
```

### Advogato Trust Metric

**Flow-Based Approach**:
Calculates maximum "flow of trust" through the network graph to determine trustworthiness.

**Key Innovation**:
- **Attack resistance**: Limits influence of malicious nodes
- **Group trust**: Certifies groups, not just individuals
- **Capacity constraints**: Each edge has maximum trust flow

**Application to Mnemosyne**:
- Collective groups have trust capacity limits
- Trust flows through MLS group memberships
- Symbolic ceremonies increase edge capacity

### ITRM (Iterative Trust and Reputation Management)

**2024 Research Shows**:
- 40% more effective than EigenTrust in adversarial conditions
- Combines direct experience with reputation propagation
- Adaptive to changing network conditions

**Core Mechanism**:
1. Direct trust from personal experience
2. Reputation trust from network consensus
3. Iterative refinement based on prediction accuracy

## Trust Metrics for Mnemosyne

### Primary Metrics

#### 1. Echo Resonance (Network Effect)
```python
echo_resonance = sum(
    reflection_count * peer_trust_level * semantic_similarity
) / time_decay
```
- Measures how often and how well others reflect your signals
- Higher weight for trusted peers
- Semantic similarity prevents gaming

#### 2. Fractal Coherence (Complexity Measure)
```python
fractal_coherence = (
    unique_concepts * depth_of_thought * consistency_over_time
) / repetition_penalty
```
- Rewards complex, consistent thinking
- Penalizes repetitive or shallow patterns
- Measures intellectual contribution

#### 3. Drift Stability (Evolution Tracking)
```python
drift_stability = 1 / (
    1 + exponential_weighted_variance(identity_changes)
)
```
- Low drift = stable identity = higher trust
- Allows evolution but rewards consistency
- Exponential weighting emphasizes recent behavior

### Composite Trust Score

```python
def calculate_trust_score(peer):
    # Base components
    echo = calculate_echo_resonance(peer)
    fractal = calculate_fractal_coherence(peer)
    drift = calculate_drift_stability(peer)
    
    # Weighted combination
    weights = {
        'echo': 0.4,      # Network validation
        'fractal': 0.3,   # Content quality
        'drift': 0.2,     # Identity stability
        'direct': 0.1     # Direct interactions
    }
    
    # Apply symbolic modifiers
    if peer.has_completed_ritual():
        trust *= 1.5
    
    if peer.initiation_level >= AGENT:
        trust *= 1.2
    
    return bounded(trust, 0, 1)
```

## Attack Resistance

### Sybil Attack Prevention

**Multi-Layer Defense**:
1. **Computational**: Proof of work for identity creation
2. **Social**: Require endorsements from existing members
3. **Symbolic**: Ritual participation creates time/effort barrier
4. **Economic**: Stake reputation/resources

### Collusion Resistance

**Based on 2024 Research**:
- Limit trust concentration (max 5% of network trust per node)
- Detect suspicious clustering via graph analysis
- Symbolic diversity requirements (can't all have same glyphs)
- Time-delay trust accumulation

### Trust Decay Mechanisms

**Without Interaction**:
```python
trust_decay_rate = 0.95 # 5% monthly decay
if months_inactive > 3:
    trust *= (trust_decay_rate ** months_inactive)
```

**With Negative Feedback**:
```python
if negative_reflection_ratio > 0.3:
    trust *= (1 - negative_reflection_ratio)
    recovery_period = 30 * negative_reflection_ratio # days
```

## Symbolic Trust Ceremonies

### Ritual-Based Verification

**Progressive Ceremony** (Default):
1. **Glyph Exchange**: Share symbolic signatures (5 min)
2. **Mirror Prompt**: Synchronized reflection exercise (15 min)
3. **Fragment Weaving**: Combine memory fragments (30 min)
4. **Covenant Creation**: Establish trust parameters (10 min)

**Cryptographic Binding**:
```python
ceremony_proof = hash(
    participant_1_glyphs +
    participant_2_glyphs +
    shared_reflection +
    timestamp
)
```

### Trust Bootstrapping for Groups

**MLS Group Formation Trust Requirements**:
1. **Manual Mode**: Creator has ULTIMATE trust with all members
2. **Threshold Mode**: Average trust > 0.6, minimum 3 members
3. **Ritual Mode**: Successful ceremony completion by all

## Implementation Recommendations

### Phase 1 (MVP)
1. **Simple EigenTrust** with pre-trusted seeds (admin accounts)
2. **Basic decay** without interaction (monthly 5% reduction)
3. **Binary ceremonies** (completed or not)

### Phase 2 (Early Adopters)
1. **Flow-based trust** for group capacity
2. **Multi-dimensional trust** (content, behavior, consistency)
3. **Symbolic modifiers** based on glyphs and archetypes

### Phase 3 (Scale)
1. **ITRM adaptive system** for dynamic networks
2. **Graph analysis** for collusion detection
3. **Predictive trust** based on behavior patterns

## Key Insights for Mnemosyne

1. **Hybrid approach works best**: Combine mathematical (EigenTrust) with social (ceremonies)
2. **Time barriers prevent gaming**: Rituals and decay create ungameable friction
3. **Symbolic layer adds uniqueness**: No other system uses glyphs for trust
4. **Group trust differs from individual**: MLS groups need capacity limits
5. **Trust must be observable**: Kartouche visualization makes trust tangible
