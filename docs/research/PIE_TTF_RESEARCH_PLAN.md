# Research & Development Plan: PIE Identity System & Trust Transaction Framework

*A comprehensive roadmap for researching, validating, and implementing the next-generation identity and trust systems*

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the research and development plan for two major architectural evolutions in the Mnemosyne Protocol:

1. **Pragmatic Identity Embedding (PIE) Pipeline**: A machine learning-based identity compression system with symbolic overlay
2. **Trust Transaction Framework (TTF)**: A practical, action-based trust system using verifiable claims and ZK-proofs

Both systems are designed to replace their more speculative predecessors (ICV and Progressive Trust Exchange) with implementable, empirically-grounded solutions while preserving the project's unique philosophical depth.

## Risk Mitigation & Fallback Plans

### Technical Risks
1. **ML model performance**: If PIE compression loses too much information
   - Fallback: Increase dimensionality or use ensemble methods
   
2. **ZK-proof efficiency**: If proof generation is too slow
   - Fallback: Use optimistic verification with penalties
   
3. **Symbolic mapping quality**: If classifiers don't achieve accuracy
   - Fallback: Use clustering-based assignment instead

### Adoption Risks
1. **User comprehension**: If system is too complex
   - Fallback: Progressive disclosure with simplified default mode
   
2. **Privacy concerns**: If users don't trust local-first architecture
   - Fallback: Offer optional cloud backup with encryption
   
3. **Gaming/attacks**: If bad actors exploit the system
   - Fallback: Implement reputation burning and quarantine mechanisms

## Conclusion

This research plan provides a clear path from the current speculative concepts to validated, implementable systems. By focusing on empirical validation at each step, we can build identity and trust systems that are both technically sound and philosophically aligned with the Mnemosyne vision.

The phased approach allows for continuous learning and adaptation, with clear fallback positions if certain approaches prove unviable. Most importantly, the plan maintains the project's commitment to user sovereignty while introducing practical innovations that can be deployed in the near term.
