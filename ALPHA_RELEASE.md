# Alpha Release Notice

*October 2025*

## What This Is

This is an **alpha release** of The Mnemosyne Protocol - a research project exploring new primitives for cognitive sovereignty. I'm releasing this code "as is" to share ideas that might resonate with or inspire others.

## Project Status

**This is a solo research project**, not a funded startup or established product. What you're seeing is:

- 75% complete Trust primitive with working appeals and negotiation
- Functional receipt system with cryptographic hashing
- Basic agentic orchestration (Shadow Council, Forum of Echoes)
- Memory and task management systems
- Many partially implemented ideas and experiments
- Honest documentation about what works vs. what's conceptual

## Expectations

### What I Can Offer
- The code and ideas as they currently exist
- Documentation of the journey and thinking behind it
- Honest assessment of what's built vs. what's research
- Novel approaches to trust, identity, and AI alignment

### What I Cannot Promise
- Regular updates or maintenance
- Timely responses to issues or PRs
- Production-ready stability
- Comprehensive support

## My Situation

I'm working on multiple projects with very limited time. This project represents genuine innovation in exploring digital sovereignty primitives, but my ability to actively develop it is scattered and inconsistent. I'm releasing it because:

1. The ideas deserve to be in the world, even if incomplete
2. Someone else might find inspiration or build upon these concepts
3. The trust primitive work (75% complete) is genuinely novel
4. Documentation alone might spark new thinking

## How to Help

If these ideas resonate with you:

- **Fork it** - Take the concepts and run with them
- **Experiment** - Try the trust primitive in your own projects
- **Document** - Share what you learn from the code
- **Build** - Create your own implementations of these ideas
- **Connect** - Open issues for discussion (I'll check when I can)

## Contact

- **GitHub Issues**: Best place for async discussion
- **Pull Requests**: Welcome, but may not be reviewed quickly
- **Forks**: Encouraged! Make it your own

## The Vision Remains

Despite limited time, I believe in these core ideas:

- **Trust without central authority** is possible and necessary
- **Cognitive sovereignty** requires new primitives, not just privacy tools
- **Research projects** can inspire even when incomplete
- **Honest documentation** matters more than polished code

## Technical Reality

- Uses OpenAI/Anthropic APIs (paradox acknowledged)
- PostgreSQL, Redis, Qdrant, FastAPI, React stack
- Docker-based deployment
- Some features are concepts only (ICV, ZK proofs)
- Code quality varies - some production-ready, some experimental

## Final Thoughts

This project asks: *What if we could build trust without authority? What if AI could respect human agency while remaining useful? What if sovereignty was a primitive, not a feature?*

I don't have all the answers, but I've documented the journey of trying to find them. Maybe you'll find something useful here. Maybe you'll be inspired to build something better. Maybe you'll just find it interesting.

Either way, it's yours now too.
