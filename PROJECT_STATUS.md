# Mnemosyne Protocol - Project Status

## Current State (2025-08-06)

### ✅ Completed Phase: Research & Integration

#### Research Completed
- **PKM Landscape**: Analyzed Mem.ai, MyMind, MemInsight - found gap for collective features
- **Agent Frameworks**: Evaluated OpenAI Swarm, CrewAI, AutoGen - none have philosophical depth
- **Trust Systems**: Researched ZK proofs, blockchain identity - simplified for MVP
- **Privacy Tech**: Studied homomorphic encryption, federated learning - deferred complex features

#### Documentation Created
1. **MNEMOSYNE_PROTOCOL_SPECIFICATION_v2.md** - Complete protocol spec with collective layer
2. **INTEGRATION_PLAN.md** - Detailed plan for merging codebases ✅
3. **PRIVACY_IMPLEMENTATION.md** - 5-layer privacy architecture
4. **MVP_FEATURES.md** - Scoped feature set for 8-week delivery
5. **CRITICAL_PATH.md** - Dependencies and blocking chains identified
6. **RESEARCH_FINDINGS_2025.md** - Competitive analysis and positioning

#### Repository Integration ✅
- Git repository initialized at `protocol/`
- All 4 codebases merged:
  - **backend/** - Mnemosyne memory engine
  - **frontend/** - React/TypeScript UI  
  - **shadow/** - Agent orchestration
  - **dialogues/** - 50+ philosophical agents
  - **collective/** - New layer with Chatter template
- Unified docker-compose.yml created
- Setup scripts and .env.example provided

### 📊 Progress Metrics

**Overall Completion**: ~40%
- Pre-existing code: 70% ✅
- Integration: 100% ✅
- New development: 0% (starting now)

**Tasks Completed**: 10/65
- Research tasks: 7/7 ✅
- Integration tasks: 3/3 ✅
- Development tasks: 0/55

### 🎯 Next Immediate Actions (Week 1)

#### Day 1-3: Memory Model Extension
```python
# Priority: CRITICAL - Blocks everything
- [ ] Add SharingContract model
- [ ] Add SharedMemory model  
- [ ] Implement selective export
- [ ] Create database migrations
```

#### Day 4-7: Shadow Integration
```python
# Priority: HIGH - Blocks agent features
- [ ] Create Mnemosyne-Shadow adapter
- [ ] Port 10 core Dialogues agents
- [ ] Implement Mycelium meta-agent
- [ ] Test agent orchestration
```

### 🚀 MVP Timeline

| Week | Focus | Deliverables |
|------|-------|--------------|
| 1-2 | Foundation | Memory model, Shadow integration |
| 3-4 | Core Features | Signal generation, consolidation |
| 5-6 | Collective | Sharing, collective agents, trust |
| 7-8 | Polish | Security, UI, documentation |

### 💡 Key Insights from Research

1. **Unique Position**: No competitor combines:
   - Personal memory engine
   - 50+ philosophical agents
   - Collective intelligence with sovereignty
   - Symbolic identity compression

2. **Technical Decisions**:
   - Use A2A Protocol (industry standard)
   - K-anonymity (k=3) for MVP privacy
   - Defer complex crypto (ZK, homomorphic) to v2
   - Leverage existing pgvector for search

3. **Risk Mitigation**:
   - Start with simple sharing contracts
   - Mock ZK proofs initially
   - Conservative privacy defaults
   - Modular architecture for iteration

```

### 📈 Success Criteria

**Week 4 Checkpoint**:
- [ ] Individual Mnemosyne functional
- [ ] Basic sharing working
- [ ] 5+ test users

**Week 8 MVP**:
- [ ] All P0 features complete
- [ ] 10+ beta users active
- [ ] 2+ test collectives
- [ ] Security audit passed

### 🎭 The Vision

> "For those who see too much and belong nowhere—this is how we build what comes next."

The Mnemosyne Protocol creates infrastructure for cognitive sovereignty and collective intelligence without surveillance or spectacle. We preserve knowledge not as archaeology but as seeds.
