## Vision

A world where your AI doesn't just assist you—it truly represents you. Where digital interactions preserve rather than erode human agency. Where collective intelligence emerges from individual sovereignty rather than corporate aggregation.

**The Mnemosyne Protocol is building cognitive sovereignty infrastructure** - technology that preserves human agency in an age of AI-mediated reality.

**Read the full vision**: [MNEMOSYNE_PRIMER.md](docs/MNEMOSYNE_PRIMER.md)

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone and setup
git clone https://github.com/ldgeorge85/Mnemosyne.git
cd Mnemosyne

# Run setup script
./scripts/setup.sh

# Configure environment
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your API keys

# Start all services
docker compose up

# Access the application
open http://localhost:3000
```

## Current Status

The project implements **cognitive sovereignty** through proven technologies while researching advanced capabilities.

### Working Now
- ✅ **Authentication System** - Secure, consolidated auth with JWT
- ✅ **Memory CRUD** - Complete with embeddings (CREATE/LIST/GET/UPDATE/DELETE)
- ✅ **Vector Storage** - Qdrant integration for semantic search
- ✅ **Chat System** - Authenticated conversations with persistence
- ✅ **Infrastructure** - Docker, PostgreSQL, Redis, all operational
- ✅ **Frontend** - React app with auth flow and API integration

### In Active Development
- 🔄 **Task System** - Time-aware action layer with gamification (NEW PRIORITY)
- 🔄 **Persona System** - Adaptive AI personality with 4 modes (accelerated priority)
- 🔄 **Worldview Adapters** - Contextual presentation system
- 🔄 **Trust Networks** - Progressive disclosure protocols
- 🔄 **ICV Validation** - Identity compression research with synthetic pilots

### Research Track (Parallel)
- 🔬 **Game Mechanics** - Task gamification and engagement patterns
- 🔬 **Identity Compression** - Holographic identity representation
- 🔬 **Productive Variation** - Controlled randomness for creativity
- 🔬 **Natural Clustering** - Organic group formation patterns
- 🔬 **Joy Metrics** - Measuring system delight and user creativity

### Next Priorities
- 🔴 **Task System Foundation** - Week 1: Basic CRUD with receipts
- 🔴 **Time Awareness** - Week 2: Calendar and scheduling
- 🔴 **Game Mechanics** - Week 3: Quests and achievements
- 🔴 **Collaboration** - Week 4: Shared tasks for trust building
- 🟡 **Complete Persona System** - Four modes with worldview adaptation
- 🟢 **Trust Network Design** - Progressive disclosure mechanisms

See [IMMEDIATE_TASKS.md](docs/IMMEDIATE_TASKS.md) for detailed execution plan.

## Architecture

### Technology Stack
- **Backend**: FastAPI + Python + Async SQLAlchemy

## Philosophy

### Core Principles
1. **Cognitive Sovereignty** - Users own their data and control their AI choices
2. **Resistance to Feudalism** - Prevent centralized control of cognition
3. **Privacy Through Architecture** - Sovereignty embedded, not added
4. **Progressive Trust** - Relationships build naturally over time
5. **Joy as Metric** - Systems without delight are already captured

### Design Philosophy
- **Contextual Presentation** - Adaptive masking based on context
- **Useful Infrastructure** - Value first, sovereignty inherent
- **Natural Emergence** - Let advanced features grow organically
- **Model Agnostic** - Interface with any AI endpoint you choose

### Who This Is For
- Those resisting cognitive feudalism
- Those building alternatives to centralized AI
- Those preserving human agency
- Those who value both utility and sovereignty

## Contributing

We're looking for collaborators who share the vision of digital sovereignty and collective intelligence.

### Immediate Needs
- **Persona System** - Complete 4-mode adaptive personality
- **ICV Research** - Validate identity compression hypothesis
- **Trust Networks** - Design progressive disclosure protocols
- **Testing** - Increase coverage and integration tests

See [Contributing Guide](docs/CONTRIBUTING.md) for details.
