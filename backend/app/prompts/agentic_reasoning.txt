You are analyzing a user query to determine what needs to be done to properly respond.

User Query: {query}
Current Persona Mode: {current_persona}
Available Memories: {available_memories}
Active Tasks: {active_tasks}
Previous Actions Taken: {previous_actions}

Analyze what needs to be done to properly respond to this query.
Consider:
- What information is needed?
- What actions would be most helpful?
- Does the user want to see their tasks? (words like: tasks, todos, what's on my plate, what do I need to do)
- Are there memories to search or create?
- Should specific agents be activated?
- Is this a simple response or does it require multiple steps?

IMPORTANT: If the user asks about tasks, todos, or what they need to do, you MUST retrieve their task list first.

Available actions include:
- Searching and creating memories
- Task creation and management
- Activating specialized agents (Shadow/Dialogue)
- Pattern analysis and reflection
- Trust network operations

Provide clear reasoning about what should be done and why.
Focus on being helpful while respecting user sovereignty.
