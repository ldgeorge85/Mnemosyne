4. **Task System**
   - Complete backend with CRUD operations
   - Balanced gamification (XP, quest types)
   - Status tracking (pending, in_progress, completed)
   - Privacy controls with visibility masking
   - Basic frontend components

5. **Persona System**
   - 4 operational modes: Confidant, Mentor, Mediator, Guardian
   - Worldview adaptation with 8 philosophical traditions
   - Context-aware mode switching
   - Integration with chat endpoint
   - Mode history tracking

6. **Receipts Backend**
   - Comprehensive database model
   - Receipt service with full CRUD
   - REST API endpoints ready
   - Statistics and filtering capabilities
   - Privacy impact tracking

7. **UI Infrastructure**
   - Persistent navigation shell (AppShell)

   - Mobile responsive design
   - shadcn/ui component library
   - Dark mode support

### üîÑ In Progress

1. **Receipt Integration**
   - Need to add generation to memory endpoints
   - Need to add generation to task endpoints
   - Need to add generation to chat endpoint
   - Frontend components needed

2. **Auth Providers**
   - OAuth provider (Google/GitHub) - stub exists
   - API key authentication - structure ready
   - DID provider - theoretical only

### ‚ùå Not Started / Broken

1. **Agent System**
   - Basic structure exists but not integrated
   - No active agent processing
   - Philosophical agents not connected

2. **Testing Infrastructure**
   - No integration tests
   - No CI/CD pipeline
   - Limited unit test coverage

3. **Advanced Features**
   - Trust networks (theoretical)
   - Identity compression (research phase)
   - Collective intelligence (future vision)

## Recent Accomplishments (August 2025)

- ‚úÖ Security activation complete - all endpoints protected
- ‚úÖ Memory UI fully implemented with CRUD operations
- ‚úÖ Persona system built with 4 modes and worldview adapters
- ‚úÖ Receipt backend infrastructure complete
- ‚úÖ Chat history and session management working
- ‚úÖ Task gamification balanced and operational
- ‚úÖ Documentation updated to reflect reality

## Immediate Priorities

1. **Receipt Integration** (Current Focus)
   - Connect receipt generation to all user actions
   - Build frontend components for transparency viewing
   - Test end-to-end receipt flow

2. **Auth Providers**
   - Implement OAuth with Google/GitHub
   - Complete API key authentication
   - Test multi-provider flow

3. **Testing & Quality**
   - Add integration tests for critical paths
   - Set up GitHub Actions CI/CD
   - Increase test coverage to >60%

## Known Issues

1. **Performance**
   - No caching strategy for embeddings
   - Database queries not optimized
   - No pagination on large lists

2. **User Experience**
   - Receipt UI components missing
   - No user settings page
   - Limited error messaging

3. **Infrastructure**
   - No monitoring/observability
   - No backup strategy
   - No rate limiting (deferred from Phase 0)

## Development Metrics

- **Codebase Size**: ~15,000 lines of code
- **Database Tables**: 10 active tables
- **API Endpoints**: 40+ endpoints
- **Frontend Pages**: 8 functional pages
- **Test Coverage**: ~25% (needs improvement)
- **Security Score**: 4/5 (OAuth pending)
- **Production Readiness**: 65%

## Resource Requirements

### Current Infrastructure
- Single Docker Compose deployment
- PostgreSQL database
- Redis cache
- Qdrant vector store
- External LLM API (user-configured)

### Recommended Next Steps
1. Complete receipt integration for transparency
2. Build receipt UI components
3. Implement OAuth providers
4. Add comprehensive testing
5. Set up CI/CD pipeline
6. Deploy to production environment

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Severity | Mitigation Status |
|------|----------|------------------|
| Security vulnerabilities | ~~Critical~~ | ‚úÖ Resolved |
| Data loss | High | ‚ö†Ô∏è Needs backup strategy |
| Performance degradation | Medium | ‚ö†Ô∏è Needs optimization |
| Feature creep | Medium | ‚úÖ Roadmap defined |
| Technical debt | Low | üîÑ Ongoing refactoring |

## Conclusion

The Mnemosyne Protocol has successfully transitioned from a vulnerable prototype to a functional system with core features operational. The immediate focus should be on completing the receipt integration for full transparency, followed by expanding authentication options and improving test coverage. The project is on track to achieve its vision of cognitive sovereignty infrastructure, with clear next steps defined and prioritized.
