# Mnemosyne Protocol: Technical Roadmap
*From Personal Tool to Planetary Intelligence*

## Overview

This roadmap defines the technical implementation path for the Mnemosyne Protocol, structured in clear phases with measurable outcomes. Each phase builds on the previous, creating a stable foundation for progressive complexity. 

**Critical Note**: The core theoretical concepts (Identity Compression, Resonance, Trust Exchange, Collective Intelligence) are [THEORETICAL] and require empirical validation before full implementation.

## Current Status

### Track 1 (Proven/Working):
- ✅ Backend authentication via AuthManager
- ✅ JWT token generation and validation  
- ✅ Chat endpoint with proper auth
- ✅ Multiple auth methods available (Static, API Key)
- ✅ Database services running (PostgreSQL, Redis, Qdrant)
- ✅ Basic FastAPI structure
- ✅ Docker infrastructure

### Track 2 (Theoretical - Requires Validation):
- ❓ Identity Compression (ICV) - Designed but unvalidated
- ❓ Progressive Trust Exchange - Protocol specified but untested
- ❓ Resonance Algorithms - Mathematical models defined, no empirical data
- ❓ Agent Communication Standards - Specification complete, not implemented
- ❓ Collective Intelligence - Conceptual framework only

### Immediate Needs:
- ❌ Frontend - Still using old auth, needs updating
- ❌ Memory CRUD - Partially implemented
- ❌ Code cleanup - Multiple competing auth patterns
- ❌ Persona implementation - Designed but not integrated

## Development Philosophy

### Dual-Track Approach
- **Track 1**: Build with proven technologies and patterns
- **Track 2**: Research and validate theoretical concepts
- Never build Track 2 features on unvalidated Track 1 assumptions
- Always maintain fallback options

### Validation Gates
Between each phase, theoretical concepts must pass validation:
- Empirical data collection
- Statistical validation 
- Fallback strategy if validation fails

## Phase Structure

### Phase 0: Security Activation ✅ COMPLETE
**Status**: COMPLETED
**Goal**: Activate existing security components to eliminate vulnerabilities

#### Tasks Completed:
1. ✅ Enable AuthManager in main.py
2. ✅ Wire AuthManager into application startup  
3. ✅ Configure Static auth provider for development
4. ✅ Remove dev-login endpoints
5. ✅ Fix user object handling in chat endpoint
6. ⏳ Add rate limiting middleware (deferred to Phase 1)
7. ✅ CORS configured properly
8. ✅ Set AUTH_REQUIRED=True

#### Success Criteria Achieved:
- ✅ All API endpoints require authentication
- ✅ No hardcoded credentials in codebase
- ✅ Zero critical security vulnerabilities
- ✅ User object properly passed to all handlers

## Implementation Order

### Immediate Priority
1. Phase 0.5: Code cleanup - Remove competing patterns
2. Phase 1: Core foundation - Memory, chat, persona

### Parallel Research Track
- ICV validation studies
- Trust protocol testing
- Resonance correlation analysis

### Conditional Development
- Only implement theoretical features after validation
- Maintain fallback strategies
- Build on proven foundations

### Decision Gates
Between phases, evaluate:
- Did research validation succeed?
- Are users finding value?
- Should we pivot or proceed?

## Critical Dependencies

The theoretical concepts have cascading dependencies:
```
Identity Compression (ICV)
    ↓ enables
Progressive Trust Exchange
    ↓ enables  
Resonance Compatibility
    ↓ enables
Agent Communication
    ↓ enables
Collective Intelligence
```

If ICV validation fails, the entire theoretical stack must be reconsidered.

## Next Actions

1. Execute Phase 0.5 code cleanup
2. Build Phase 1 core features (proven tech only)
3. Start research validation studies in parallel
4. Make go/no-go decisions based on validation results
