# Immediate Task Breakdown for Mnemosyne Protocol
*Building Cognitive Sovereignty Through Iterative Development*

## Critical Path Forward

### Guiding Principles
- **Contextual Presentation**: Adaptive masking based on context, not hierarchy
- **Accelerated Personas**: Worldview integration moved to immediate priority
- **Synthetic Validation**: Test with synthetic identities before real users
- **Joy as Metric**: Track unexpected delight and creativity spikes
- **Natural Emergence**: Let advanced features grow organically
- **Model Agnostic**: All AI via user-configured API endpoints

### Phase 0.5: Code Cleanup âœ… COMPLETE

#### Task Group A: Audit Current State âœ…
- [x] List all auth-related files and identify competing patterns
- [x] Document which auth system is actually running (AUTH_AUDIT_REPORT.md)
- [x] Identify all deprecated imports and dead code
- [x] Find all hardcoded credentials and dev endpoints
- [x] List all half-implemented features

#### Task Group B: Delete Ruthlessly âœ…

- [x] Fix import statements throughout
- [x] Authentication now required (401 responses)

**Success Criteria**:

## For Each Task Session

When starting a task, provide this context to AI:

```markdown
PROJECT: Mnemosyne Protocol
CURRENT PHASE: [Phase 0.5/1/1.5]
TASK GROUP: [A-I]
SPECIFIC TASK: [exact task from list]
FILES INVOLVED: [list files]
DEPENDENCIES: [what must be done first]
SUCCESS CRITERIA: [how to know it's done]
TEST COMMAND: [how to verify]
```

## Red Flags to Stop Work

STOP and reassess if you encounter:
- More than 3 competing patterns for same feature
- Critical security vulnerability in running code  
- Database schema fundamentally broken
- Missing critical dependencies
- Tests failing on main branch

1. âœ… Delete `simple_auth.py` (DONE)
2. âœ… Set `AUTH_REQUIRED=True` in config (DONE)
3. âœ… Remove hardcoded credentials (DONE)
4. âœ… Fix deprecation warnings (DONE)
5. âœ… Update frontend auth endpoints (DONE)
