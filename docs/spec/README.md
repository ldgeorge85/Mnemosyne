# Specification Documents

## Status Warning

These specifications were written in August 2024 and describe both implemented and aspirational features. They should be read as design documents, not implementation reality.

## Implementation Status

For accurate current implementation status, see:
- `/docs/PROJECT_STATUS.md` - Reality check with [IMPLEMENTED], [PARTIAL], [UNVERIFIED] labels
- `/review/` - October 2024 comprehensive assessment

## Documents

- **OVERVIEW.md** - System overview (mix of built and conceptual)
- **PROTOCOL.md** - Protocol specification (largely aspirational)
- **PERSONA_WORLDVIEW.md** - Persona system design (partially implemented)

## Key Gaps

Major unimplemented specifications:
- Identity Compression Vectors (ICV) - No code
- W3C DID integration - Environment variables only
- Zero-knowledge proofs - Not implemented
- Progressive disclosure - Owner-only, not relationship-based
- Multi-party trust negotiation - Conceptual
