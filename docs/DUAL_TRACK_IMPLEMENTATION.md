# Mnemosyne Dual-Track Implementation Plan

## Executive Summary

Following critical review findings that core scientific claims remain unvalidated, we are implementing a dual-track development approach:

1. **Track 1: Implementation (Core)** - Stable, proven features with standard cryptography
2. **Track 2: Research (Experimental)** - Sandboxed modules for hypothesis validation

This separation ensures we can deliver value while conducting necessary empirical validation.

## Current State Assessment

### Existing Issues Identified
- Identity compression code (`backend/models/signal.py`) assumes unproven 100-128 bit representation
- No clear separation between proven and experimental features
- Missing infrastructure for longitudinal studies and validation metrics
- No consent workflows for research data collection
- Lacking modular plugin system for experimental features

### Existing Strengths
- User system already uses standard UUIDs (no compression)
- Basic memory/chat infrastructure in place
- Docker deployment ready
- Database migrations established

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Core Refactoring (Week 1-2)

#### 1.1 Plugin Architecture
```python
# backend/app/core/plugins/__init__.py
class PluginInterface:
    """Base interface for all plugins"""
    def __init__(self, config: dict):
        self.enabled = config.get('enabled', False)
        self.experimental = config.get('experimental', True)
        self.hypothesis_doc = config.get('hypothesis_doc', '')
    
    async def initialize(self): pass
    async def shutdown(self): pass
    def get_status(self) -> dict: pass
```

#### 1.2 Feature Flag System
```python
# backend/app/core/features.py
class FeatureFlags:
    """Centralized feature flag management"""
    EXPERIMENTAL_ID_COMPRESSION = "experimental.id_compression"
    EXPERIMENTAL_BEHAVIORAL_TRACKING = "experimental.behavioral_tracking"
    EXPERIMENTAL_RESONANCE = "experimental.resonance"
    
    @classmethod
    def is_enabled(cls, flag: str, user_id: str = None) -> bool:
        # Check global, per-instance, and per-user flags
        pass
```

#### 1.3 Research Bus
```python
# backend/app/core/research_bus.py
class ResearchBus:
    """Event bus for publishing anonymized data to research track"""
    async def publish(self, event_type: str, data: dict, consent_id: str):

class ConsentManager:
    """IRB-compliant consent workflows"""
    
    async def request_consent(self, user_id: str, study_id: str) -> ConsentRequest:

    experimental = True
    hypothesis_doc = "docs/research/hypotheses/id_compression.md"
    
    async def compress(self, behavioral_data: dict) -> bytes:
        if not FeatureFlags.is_enabled(FeatureFlags.EXPERIMENTAL_ID_COMPRESSION):
            raise ExperimentalFeatureDisabled()
        # Implementation here

### Implementation Notes

#### Key Design Decisions Made
1. **Experimental features disabled by default** - Require explicit opt-in via feature flags
2. **Mandatory hypothesis documentation** - Every experimental module must link to validation criteria
3. **Multi-level anonymization** - Basic, differential privacy, and full anonymization options
4. **Plugin status tracking** - Real-time validation metrics and status reporting
5. **Research event prioritization** - Critical, high, normal, low priority levels for event processing

#### Technical Highlights
- Research Bus implements differential privacy with Laplacian noise generation
- Plugin registry enforces separation at registration time
- Feature flags support per-user and per-instance overrides
- Consent verification integrated into event publishing pipeline

## Next Steps
