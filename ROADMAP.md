# The Mnemosyne Protocol - Development Roadmap

## Philosophy: No Mocking, Only Real Implementation

We build real features or we defer them. No fake implementations, no mock systems. Every line of code serves actual sovereignty.

## Risk Management

### Technical Risks
| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Privacy breach | Critical | K-anonymity, audit, conservative defaults |
| Performance issues | High | Caching, async, load testing |
| Integration complexity | Medium | Modular architecture, adapters |
| Agent incoherence | Medium | Mycelium monitoring, fracture index |

### Adoption Risks
| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| User confusion | High | Clear onboarding, immediate value |
| Trust bootstrapping | High | Progressive revelation, reputation |
| Community building | Medium | Early adopter program, documentation |
| Sustainability | Medium | Open source, community ownership |

## Development Principles

1. **No Mocking**: Build real or defer
2. **Privacy First**: Every feature respects sovereignty
3. **Modular**: Each component provides standalone value
4. **Documented**: Code explains itself, docs explain why
5. **Tested**: Security > Features
6. **Open**: Community ownership from day one

---

## How It All Comes Together

### The User Journey

**Week 1-2**: Individual Memory
- User installs personal Mnemosyne
- Captures thoughts and memories
- Agents begin reflecting and organizing

**Week 3-4**: Identity Formation
- System generates Deep Signal
- Creates visual kartouche
- User refines their symbolic identity

**Week 5-6**: Collective Connection
- User joins first collective
- Shares selected memories
- Discovers complementary skills
- Builds trust through interaction

**Week 7-8**: Emergent Intelligence
- Collective synthesizes knowledge
- Gaps identified and filled
- Community resilience increases
- Network effects begin

### The Technical Journey

**Foundation**: Merge existing code → extend for sharing
**Intelligence**: Add agents → create orchestration
**Identity**: Generate signals → visualize symbols
**Community**: Enable sharing → preserve privacy
**Trust**: Build reputation → prevent gaming
**Scale**: Optimize → deploy → monitor
